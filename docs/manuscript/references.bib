	abstract = {There is a very large literature examining income inequality in relation to health. Early reviews came to different interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short. The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations.},

	abstract = {Background Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Aim We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased. Methods We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95\% credible interval (CrI): 3.78–6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95\% CrI: 3.01–4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48\% (95\% CrI: 32–67) for Singapore and 62\% (95\% CrI: 50–76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information. Conclusion High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.},

Therefore, short-term forecasts of incidence are often of high priority. In light of the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, a forecasting exercise was convened by a network of infectious disease modellers. The challenge was to forecast unseen “future” simulated data for four different scenarios at five different time points. In a similar method to that used during the recent Ebola epidemic, we estimated current levels of transmissibility, over variable time-windows chosen in an ad hoc way. Current estimated transmissibility was then used to forecast near-future incidence. We performed well within the challenge and often produced accurate forecasts. A retrospective analysis showed that our subjective method for deciding on the window of time with which to estimate transmissibility often resulted in the optimal choice. However, when near-future trends deviated substantially from exponential patterns, the accuracy of our forecasts was reduced. This exercise highlights the urgent need for infectious disease modellers to develop more robust descriptions of processes – other than the widespread depletion of susceptible individuals – that produce non-exponential patterns of incidence.},

R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size, but estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated directly from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval – the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r–R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.},

In particular, children have been shown to play a key role in influenza transmission during recent outbreaks, and targeted interventions, such as school closures, could positively impact the course of emerging epidemics. As an outbreak is unfolding, it is important to be able to estimate reproductive numbers that incorporate this heterogeneity and to use surveillance data that is routinely collected to more effectively target interventions and obtain an accurate understanding of transmission dynamics. There are a growing number of methods that estimate age-group specific reproductive numbers with limited data that build on methods assuming a homogenously mixing population. In this article, we introduce a new approach that is flexible and improves on many aspects of existing methods. We apply this method to influenza data from two outbreaks, the 2009 H1N1 outbreaks in South Africa and Japan, to estimate age-group specific reproductive numbers and compare it to three other methods that also use existing data from social mixing surveys to quantify contact rates among different age groups. In this exercise, all estimates of the reproductive numbers for children exceeded the critical threshold of one and in most cases exceeded those of adults. We introduce a flexible new method to estimate reproductive numbers that describe heterogeneity in the population.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review 
        This review analyzed legal and ethical issues surrounding recent doctor and healthcare worker (HCW) strikes and considered whether HCW strikes are legally and morally justifiable, underlying causes, and impact of such strikes on healthcare service delivery.
        Recent findings 
        Recent reports show that doctor and HCW strikes are an ongoing phenomenon globally, occurring in both developed and developing countries. The main reasons for HCW strikes are failed employer–employee negotiations regarding fair wages and working conditions, policy issues, infrastructural deficiencies in poorer countries, and concerns by HCWs regarding personal security in the workplace. The main impact of HCW strikes is disruption of healthcare service delivery, such as canceled outpatients’ appointments, hospital admissions, and elective surgeries. There was no clear evidence of increased patients’ mortality during strikes, except in isolated cases, where emergency services were also withdrawn during strikes.
        Summary 
        Doctors and HCWs strikes are lawful deadlock-breaking mechanisms when collective bargaining negotiations have reached an impasse. Doctors’ strikes appear to create an ethical conflict with the Hippocratic tradition and obligation to place patients’ best interests as the primary moral consideration in medical practice. However, the rise of consumerism in healthcare, and loss of power by doctors, many of whom now work as employees, subject to regulations imposed by different stakeholders, including governments, health-maintenance organizations, and healthcare insurers, has impacted on modern medical practice. Therefore, doctors, like other employees may occasionally resort to strikes to extract concessions from employers. Mortality is rarely increased during HCW strikes, especially where emergency healthcare services are provided.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

	abstract = {Purpose 
        The practice of medicine is rarely straightforward. Data used to facilitate medical decision making may be conflicting, ambiguous, or scarce, and providing optimal care requires balancing clinicians’ expertise and available evidence with patients’ preferences. To explore uncertainty in decision making across disciplines, the authors performed a scoping review and thematic analysis of the literature to formulate a model describing the decision-making process in medicine under uncertain conditions.
        Method 
        In 2016, the authors performed a comprehensive search of key databases using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary. They identified and reviewed 3,398 records. After applying their inclusion and exclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts and then full texts, 19 articles were selected. The authors applied a qualitative thematic analysis to these articles, using codes to extract themes related to uncertainty in decision making.
        Results 
        The 19 articles spanned 6 fields of study and 5 disciplines within the health sciences. The thematic analysis revealed 6 main themes: recognition of uncertainty, classification of uncertainty, stakeholder perspectives, knowledge acquisition, decision-making approach, and evaluation of the decision-making process.
        Conclusions 
        Based on the themes that emerged from their thematic analysis of the literature characterizing the effects of uncertainty and ambiguity on the decision-making process, the authors developed a framework depicting the interplay between these themes with a visual representation of the decision-making process under uncertain conditions. Future research includes further development and validation of this framework to inform medical school curricula.},

Currently, reference values are set for the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel, and pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are issued based on these values. In this study, we examined the association between these reference values and the effective reproduction number (Rt) using surveillance data for Miyazaki Prefecture collected from 2010 to 2011. There are nine public health centre jurisdictions in this prefecture, and Rt exceeded 1.0 at the time when pre-epidemic warnings were issued in almost all the jurisdictions. Thus, it was indicated that the validity of the reference value was also high for influenza transmission. However, our results indicated the presence of secondary epidemic caused by infections originating both from other jurisdictions and inner jurisdictions, and it is occasionally not possible to evaluate the end of an epidemic in a jurisdiction using only the reference value of termination. It is necessary to establish new methods after considering the situation in the surrounding jurisdictions for more detailed epidemic predictions.},

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.},

	abstract = {Causality in pharmacovigilance is a difficult and time consuming exercise. This paper presents the challenges in determining causation by drug therapy. The first is that causation is complex and needs to be viewed from the context of the patient treated, rather than the drug product. Multiple causal vectors should be considered if we are to tackle the many issues involved in, for example, medication error and the many other factors that lead to bad outcomes from therapy, including failure to recognise known risk factors. The aim of pharmacovigilance is not only a bureaucratic exercise in public health norms, but is mainly concerned with small minorities of statistical outliers—and even individuals—whose experiences from harms may together form messages about causation that will prevent further at-risk patients from exposure, or at least assist with earlier recognition of drug-related harm and better management of such harm. This requires more time, more data, more analysis and more patient and clinical involvement in reporting useful clinical detail. The paradigm shift back towards gathering more case data relating to possible causation can be selective and would not be just retrogressive, nor necessarily too costly. Greater transparency of hypotheses and availability of anonymised case data will enrol more expertise into evaluations and hypothesis testing, and the provision of more complete and useful information should reduce clinical burdens from bad patient outcomes as well as their overall costs to society.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists study associations but they are usually interested in causation that could lead to disease prevention. Experience show, however, that many of the associations we identify are not the causes we take an interest in (correlation is not causation). In order to proper translate association into causes, a set of causal criteria was developed 50–60 years ago and they became important tools guiding this translational process (sometimes correlation is causation). Best known of these are the Bradford Hill ‘criteria’. In these last 50 years, epidemiologic theory and infrastructure have advanced rapidly without changes in these causal criteria. We think time has come to revisit the ‘old’ criteria to see which ones we should keep and which ones should be taken out or be replaced by new measures of association. Robustness of these criteria in attempts to make the association go away should have high priority. A group of renowned internationally recognized researchers should have this task. Since classifying associations as causes is often done in order to reduce or eliminate the exposures of concern results from conditional outcome research should also be used. We therefore suggest to add a ‘consequence’ criterion. We argue that a consequence criterion that provides a framework for assessing or prescribing action worthy or right in social contexts is needed. A consequence criterion will also influence how strict our causal criteria need to be before leading to action and will help in separating the ‘causal discussion’ and the discussion on what to do about it. A consequence criterion will be a tool in handling dilemmas over values (as social solidarity, fairness, autonomy). It will have implications for the interpretation and use of the procedural criteria of causality. Establishing interconnected procedural and consequence criteria should be a task for institutions representing and being recognized by experts, civil society and the state.},

Theories of disease causation, however, have not quite been developed in accordance with this view. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a fundamental explication of aspects of causation relevant for discussing causes of disease. The first part of the analysis will discuss discrimination between singular and general causality. Singular causality, as in the specific patient, is a relation between a concrete sequence of causally linked events. General causation, e.g. as in disease etiology, means various categories of causal relations between event types. The paper introduces the concept of a reference case serving as a source for causal inference, reaching beyond the concept of general causality. The second part of the analysis provides exemplification of a theory of causation suitable for discussing singular causation. The chain of events that induce a disease state can be identified as effective causal complexes, each complex composed of non-redundant components, which separately contribute to the effect of the complex, without the individual component being necessary or sufficient in itself to produce the effect. In the third part of the analysis the theory is elaborated further. Causes, defined as non-redundant components, can furthermore be differentiated according to their avoidability, according to theories about human error or by the potential of eradication. Multifactorial models of disease creates a need for systematic approaches to causal factors. The paper proposes a taxonomical terminology that serves this purpose.},

	abstract = {In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill published nine “viewpoints” to help determine if observed epidemiologic associations are causal. Since then, the “Bradford Hill Criteria” have become the most frequently cited framework for causal inference in epidemiologic studies. However, when Hill published his causal guidelines—just 12 years after the double-helix model for DNA was first suggested and 25 years before the Human Genome Project began—disease causation was understood on a more elementary level than it is today. Advancements in genetics, molecular biology, toxicology, exposure science, and statistics have increased our analytical capabilities for exploring potential cause-and-effect relationships, and have resulted in a greater understanding of the complexity behind human disease onset and progression. These additional tools for causal inference necessitate a re-evaluation of how each Bradford Hill criterion should be interpreted when considering a variety of data types beyond classic epidemiology studies. Herein, we explore the implications of data integration on the interpretation and application of the criteria. Using examples of recently discovered exposure–response associations in human disease, we discuss novel ways by which researchers can apply and interpret the Bradford Hill criteria when considering data gathered using modern molecular techniques, such as epigenetics, biomarkers, mechanistic toxicology, and genotoxicology.},

These considerations were often applied as a checklist of criteria, although they were by no means intended to be used in this way by Hill himself. Hill, however, avoided defining explicitly what he meant by "causal effect"., This paper provides a fresh point of view on Hill's considerations from the perspective of counterfactual causality. I argue that counterfactual arguments strongly contribute to the question of when to apply the Hill considerations. Some of the considerations, however, involve many counterfactuals in a broader causal system, and their heuristic value decreases as the complexity of a system increases; the danger of misapplying them can be high. The impacts of these insights for study design and data analysis are discussed. The key analysis tool to assess the applicability of Hill's considerations is multiple bias modelling (Bayesian methods and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis); these methods should be used much more frequently.},

This article begins by sketching the historical origins of this phrase and the concept of the gene-phenotype relationship that underlies it. Five criteria are then proposed to evaluate the appropriateness of the “X is a gene for Y” concept: 1) strength of association, 2) specificity of relationship, 3) noncontingency of effect, 4) causal proximity of X to Y, and 5) the degree to which X is the appropriate level of explanation for Y. Evidence from psychiatric genetics is then reviewed that address each of these criteria. The concept of “a gene for…” is best understood as deriving from preformationist developmental theory in which genes—like preformationist anlagen—“code for” traits in a simple, direct, and powerful way. However, the genetic contribution to psychiatric disorders fails to meet any of the five criteria for the concept of “X is a gene for Y.” The impact of individual genes on risk for psychiatric illness is small, often nonspecific, and embedded in complex causal pathways. The phrase “a gene for…” and the preformationist concept of gene action that underlies it are inappropriate for psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to elucidate three characteristics of causal relationships that are important in biological contexts. Stability has to do with whether a causal relationship continues to hold under changes in background conditions. Proportionality has to do with whether changes in the state of the cause “line up” in the right way with changes in the state of the effect and with whether the cause and effect are characterized in a way that contains irrelevant detail. Specificity is connected both to David Lewis’ notion of “influence” and also with the extent to which a causal relation approximates to the ideal of one cause–one effect. Interrelations among these notions and their possible biological significance are also discussed.},

It also introduces the notion of conditional independence or irrelevance, which I claim is central to understanding the respects and the extent to which upper level explanations can be “autonomous”.},

Developmentalism helps resolve a number of long-standing dialectics concerned with causality, including reductionism/holism, orthogenesis/adaptation, and stasis/ change. In biological sciences, developmentalism engenders a discourse that overcomes barriers imposed by the still-dominant paradigms of molecular reductionism on the one hand and Darwinian evolution on the other. With regard to the former, it provides a better interpretive framework for the new science of “systems-biology,” which seeks to elucidate regulatory networks that control ontogeny, stem cell biology, and the etiology of disease. With regard to the latter, it provides an intelligible bridge between chemistry and biology, and hence an explanation for the natural origin of life. Finally, developmentalism, being an inherently ecological perspective, is well suited as a paradigm for addressing problems of environmental management and sustainability.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is the study of the causal relationship. The concept called “naive” causality can be stated more generally as the belief (or knowledge) that results follow actions, and that these results are not random, but are consistently linked with causes. The authors have thus formed a very general and precarious concept of causality, but one that appropriately reflects the meaning of causality at the level of common sense. Design/methodology/approach Mathematical and logical development of the causality in complex systems. Findings There are three aspects of rationality that give the human mind a unique vision of reality: quantification: reduction of phenomena to quantitative terms; cause and effect: causal relationship, which allows predicting; and the necessary and valid use of (deterministic) mechanical models. This work is dedicated to the second aspect, that of causality, but at present leaves aside the discussion of possibility-necessity, proposing a modification to philosophical synthesis of causality specified by Bunge (1959), with contributions made by Patten et al. (1976) and LeShan and Margenau (1982). Originality/value Causality is an epistemological category, because it concerns the experience and knowledge of the human subject, without being necessarily a property of reality.},

	abstract = {Importance: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are commonly prescribed with other medications that share metabolic pathways that may increase major bleeding risk.
Objective: To assess the association between use of NOACs with and without concurrent medications and risk of major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and including 91 330 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who received at least 1 NOAC prescription of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016, with final follow-up on December 31, 2016.
Exposures: NOAC with or without concurrent use of atorvastatin; digoxin; verapamil; diltiazem; amiodarone; fluconazole; ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole; cyclosporine; erythromycin or clarithromycin; dronedarone; rifampin; or phenytoin.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Major bleeding, defined as hospitalization or emergency department visit with a primary diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal, urogenital, or other bleeding. Adjusted incidence rate differences between person-quarters (exposure time for each person during each quarter of the calendar year) of NOAC with or without concurrent medications were estimated using Poisson regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score.
Results: Among 91 330 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (mean age, 74.7 years [SD, 10.8]; men, 55.8\%; NOAC exposure: dabigatran, 45 347 patients; rivaroxaban, 54 006 patients; and apixaban, 12 886 patients), 4770 major bleeding events occurred during 447 037 person-quarters with NOAC prescriptions. The most common medications co-prescribed with NOACs over all person-quarters were atorvastatin (27.6\%), diltiazem (22.7\%), digoxin (22.5\%), and amiodarone (21.1\%). Concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin with NOACs had a significant increase in adjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-years of major bleeding than NOACs alone: 38.09 for NOAC use alone vs 52.04 for amiodarone (difference, 13.94 [99\% CI, 9.76-18.13]); 102.77 for NOAC use alone vs 241.92 for fluconazole (difference, 138.46 [99\% CI, 80.96-195.97]); 65.66 for NOAC use alone vs 103.14 for rifampin (difference, 36.90 [99\% CI, 1.59-72.22); and 56.07 for NOAC use alone vs 108.52 for phenytoin (difference, 52.31 [99\% CI, 32.18-72.44]; P {\textless} .01 for all comparisons). Compared with NOAC use alone, the adjusted incidence rate for major bleeding was significantly lower for concurrent use of atorvastatin, digoxin, and erythromycin or clarithromycin and was not significantly different for concurrent use of verapamil; diltiazem; cyclosporine; ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole; and dronedarone.
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients taking NOACs for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin compared with the use of NOACs alone, was associated with increased risk of major bleeding. Physicians prescribing NOAC medications should consider the potential risks associated with concomitant use of other drugs.},

	abstract = {I use some recent formal work on measuring causation to explore a suggestion by James Woodward: that the notion of causal specificity can clarify the distinction in biology between permissive and instructive causes. This distinction arises when a complex developmental process, such as the formation of an entire body part, can be triggered by a simple switch, such as the presence of particular protein. In such cases, the protein is said to merely induce or "permit" the developmental process, whilst the causal "instructions" for guiding that process are already prefigured within the cells. I construct a novel model that expresses in a simple and tractable way the relevant causal structure of biological development and then use a measure of causal specificity to analyse the model. I show that the permissive-instructive distinction cannot be captured by simply contrasting the specificity of two causes as Woodward proposes, and instead introduce an alternative, hierarchical approach to analysing the interaction between two causes. The resulting analysis highlights the importance of focusing on gene regulation, rather than just the coding regions, when analysing the distinctive causal power of genes.},

I argue that, although the Russo–Williamson thesis conflicts with the tenets of present-day evidence-based medicine (EBM), it offers a better causal epistemology than that provided by present-day EBM because it better explains two key aspects of causal discovery.

Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and mean left atrial pressure (LAP) cannot be used interchangeably as they will often differ in magnitude in the presence of cardiac disease and they also have different clinical significance. LVEDP is the best pressure to use when considering left ventricular function, whereas mean LAP is the most relevant pressure when considering the tendency to pulmonary congestion. The mean LAP is also the most relevant pressure for determining whether pulmonary hypertension has a left heart (post-capillary) component. If only a left ventricular pressure tracing is available then a technique to measure the mean left ventricular diastolic pressure is the best option for estimating the mean LAP. If only right heart pressures are available then the pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure will provide a reasonable estimate of LVEDP, but only when the heart and pulmonary circulation are normal. If there is mitral valve disease, left ventricular disease or pulmonary hypertension the LVEDP cannot be estimated from right heart pressures. The problem of the ambiguity of “filling pressure (s)” is readily solved by the abandonment of this term and the use of either LVEDP or mean LAP as appropriate.},

RAS caused by fibromuscular dysplasia is probably commoner than previously appreciated, should be actively looked for in younger hypertensive patients and can be managed successfully with angioplasty. Atheromatous RAS is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events and increased cardiovascular mortality, and is likely to be seen with increasing frequency. Evidence from large clinical trials has led clinicians away from recommending interventional revascularisation towards aggressive medical management. There is now interest in looking more closely at patient selection for intervention, with focus on intervening only in patients with the highest-risk presentations such as flash pulmonary oedema, rapidly declining renal function and severe resistant hypertension. The potential benefits in terms of improving hard cardiovascular outcomes may outweigh the risks of intervention in this group, and further research is needed.},

	abstract = {Since the early 1800s vaccines have saved numerous lives by preventing lethal infections. However, during the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of possible adverse events associated with vaccinations, cultivating heated debates and leading to significant fluctuations in vaccination rates. It is therefore pertinent for the scientific community to seriously address public concern of adverse effects of vaccines to regain public trust in these important medical interventions. Such adverse reactions to vaccines may be viewed as a result of the interaction between susceptibility of the vaccinated subject and various vaccine components. Among the implicated mechanisms for these reactions is molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry refers to a significant similarity between certain pathogenic elements contained in the vaccine and specific human proteins. This similarity may lead to immune crossreactivity, wherein the reaction of the immune system towards the pathogenic antigens may harm the similar human proteins, essentially causing autoimmune disease. In this review, we address the concept of molecular mimicry and its application in explaining post vaccination autoimmune phenomena. We further review the principal examples of the influenza, hepatitis B, and human papilloma virus vaccines, all suspected to induce autoimmunity via molecular mimicry. Finally, we refer to possible implications on the potential future development of better, safer vaccines.},

For centuries, indigenous cultures around the world have used traditional herbal medicine to treat a myriad of maladies. By contrast, the rise of the modern pharmaceutical industry in the past century has been based on exploiting individual active compounds with precise modes of action. This surge has yielded highly effective drugs that are widely used in the clinic, including many plant natural products and analogues derived from these products, but has fallen short of delivering effective cures for complex human diseases with complicated causes, such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and degenerative diseases. While the plant kingdom continues to serve as an important source for chemical entities supporting drug discovery, the rich traditions of herbal medicine developed by trial and error on human subjects over thousands of years contain invaluable biomedical information just waiting to be uncovered using modern scientific approaches. Here we provide an evolutionary and historical perspective on why plants are of particular significance as medicines for humans. We highlight several plant natural products that are either in the clinic or currently under active research and clinical development, with particular emphasis on their mechanisms of action. Recent efforts in developing modern multi-herb prescriptions through rigorous molecular-level investigations and standardized clinical trials are also discussed. Emerging technologies, such as genomics and synthetic biology, are enabling new ways for discovering and utilizing the medicinal properties of plants. We are entering an exciting era where the ancient wisdom distilled into the world's traditional herbal medicines can be reinterpreted and exploited through the lens of modern science.},

However, existing work has not systematically differentiated between the growth rate of hospital prices and that of physician prices. We analyzed growth in both types of prices for inpatient and hospital-based outpatient services using actual negotiated prices paid by insurers. We found that in the period 2007–14 hospital prices grew substantially faster than physician prices. For inpatient care, hospital prices grew 42 percent, while physician prices grew 18 percent. Similarly, for hospital-based outpatient care, hospital prices grew 25 percent, while physician prices grew 6 percent. A majority of the growth in payments for inpatient and hospital-based outpatient care was driven by growth in hospital prices, not physician prices. Our work suggests that efforts to reduce health care spending should be primarily focused on addressing growth in hospital rather than physician prices. Policy makers should consider a range of options to address hospital price growth, including antitrust enforcement, administered pricing, the use of reference pricing, and incentivizing referring physicians to make more cost-efficient referrals.},

	abstract = {The identification of unanticipated statistical associations is a core activity in exploratory analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data. Specifically, post-marketing surveillance for harmful effects of medicines relies on effective algorithms to detect associations between drugs and suspected adverse drug reactions. The WHO global individual case safety reports database, VigiBase, holds over six million reports and covers more than ten thousand medicinal products and thousands of distinct medical concepts. It collects data from more than 100 countries across the world and its first reports date back to the late 1960s. Local patterns may not show in database-wide analyses, and many others will vary substantially in strength or direction across data subsets. Still, routine screening of this and similar databases relies on global measures of association. In this paper, we propose a framework to detect local associations and characterise subset variability in high-dimensional data. We use shrinkage observed-to-expected ratios and employ multiple stratification by one or two covariates at a time. We consider subset-specific, stratified-then-pooled adjusted measures, and a novel measure to detect associations that hold in all-but-one subset. We use covariate permutation to select stratification covariates and gauge the vulnerability to spurious associations. Chance findings are a major concern! A naive subgroup analysis yielded more than 50\% spurious local associations in VigiBase. To improve on this, we enforce conservative credibility intervals and also look for subset-specific associations that reproduce in at least one additional subset (e.g. two time periods). In addition to 119,500 global associations between drugs and medical events in VigiBase, such robust subgroup analysis uncovered 14,600 local associations at an estimated rate of 2.2\% spurious.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The database of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) held by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre on behalf of the 47 countries of the World Health Organization  (WHO) Collaborating Programme for International Drug Monitoring contains nearly two million reports. It is the largest database of this sort in the world, and about 35,000 new reports are added quarterly. The task of trying to find new drug-ADR signals has been carried out by an expert panel, but with such a large volume of material the task is daunting. We have developed a flexible, automated  procedure to find new signals with known probability difference from the background data. METHOD: Data mining, using various computational approaches, has been applied in a variety of disciplines. A Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) has been developed which can manage large data sets, is robust in handling incomplete data, and may be used with complex variables. Using information theory, such a tool is ideal for finding drug-ADR combinations with other variables, which are highly associated compared to the generality of the stored data, or a section of the stored data. The method is transparent for easy  checking and flexible for different kinds of search. RESULTS: Using the BCPNN, some time scan examples are given which show the power of the technique to find signals early (captopril-coughing) and to avoid false positives where a common drug and ADRs occur in the database (digoxin-acne; digoxin-rash). A routine application of the BCPNN to a quarterly update is also tested, showing that 1004  suspected drug-ADR combinations reached the 97.5\% confidence level of difference  from the generality. Of these, 307 were potentially serious ADRs, and of these 53 related to new drugs. Twelve of the latter were not recorded in the CD editions of The physician's Desk Reference or Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoea and did not  appear in Reactions Weekly online. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the BCPNN can be used in the detection of significant signals from the data set of the WHO Programme on International Drug Monitoring. The BCPNN will be an extremely useful adjunct to the expert assessment of very large numbers of spontaneously reported ADRs.},

Collections of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) related to suspected ADR incidents in clinical practice have proven to be very useful in post-marketing surveillance for pairwise drug–ADR associations, but have yet to reach their full potential for drug–drug interaction surveillance. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a shrinkage observed-to-expected ratio for exploratory analysis of suspected drug–drug interaction in ICSR data, based on comparison with an additive risk model. We argue that the limited success of previously proposed methods for drug–drug interaction detection based on ICSR data may be due to an underlying assumption that the absence of interaction is equivalent to having multiplicative risk factors. We provide empirical examples of established drug–drug interaction highlighted with our proposed approach that go undetected with logistic regression. A database wide screen for suspected drug–drug interaction in the entire WHO database is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As always in the analysis of ICSRs, the clinical validity of hypotheses raised with the proposed method must be further reviewed and evaluated by subject matter experts.

The ultimate goal of many of these studies is to construct networks associating transcription factors with genes via well-defined binding sites. Weaker regulatory interactions other than those occurring at high-affinity binding sites are largely ignored and are not well understood. Here I show that low-affinity interactions are abundant in vivo and quantifiable from current high-throughput ChIP experiments. I develop algorithms that predict DNA-binding energies from sequences and ChIP data across a wide dynamic range of affinities and use them to reveal widespread functionality of low-affinity transcription factor binding. Evolutionary analysis suggests that binding energies of many transcription factors are conserved even in promoters lacking classical binding sites. Gene expression analysis shows that such promoters can generate significant expression. I estimate that while only a small percentage of the genome is strongly regulated by a typical transcription factor, up to an order of magnitude more may be involved in weaker interactions. Low-affinity transcription factor-DNA interaction may therefore be important both evolutionarily and functionally.},

Despite tremendous efforts from the scientific community to conduct TF ChIP-seq experiments, the available data represent only a limited percentage of ChIP-seq experiments, considering all possible combinations of TFs and cell lines. In this study, we demonstrate a method for accurately predicting cell-specific TF binding for TF-cell line combinations based on only a small fraction (4\%) of the combinations using available ChIP-seq data. The proposed model, termed TFImpute, is based on a deep neural network with a multi-task learning setting to borrow information across transcription factors and cell lines. Compared with existing methods, TFImpute achieves comparable accuracy on TF-cell line combinations with ChIP-seq data; moreover, TFImpute achieves better accuracy on TF-cell line combinations without ChIP-seq data. This approach can predict cell line specific enhancer activities in K562 and HepG2 cell lines, as measured by massively parallel reporter assays, and predicts the impact of SNPs on TF binding.},

	abstract = {Cooperative interactions by DNA-binding proteins have been implicated in cell-fate decisions in a variety of organisms. To date, however, there are few examples in which the importance of such interactions has been explicitly tested in vivo. Here, we tested the importance of cooperative DNA binding by the Bicoid protein in establishing a pattern along the anterior-posterior axis of the early Drosophila embryo. We found that bicoid mutants specifically defective in cooperative DNA binding fail to direct proper development of the head and thorax, leading to embryonic lethality. The mutants did not faithfully stimulate transcription of downstream target genes such as hunchback (hb), giant, and Krüppel. Quantitative analysis of gene expression in vivo indicated that bcd cooperativity mutants were unable to accurately direct the extent to which hb is expressed along the anterior-posterior axis and displayed a reduced ability to generate sharp on/off transitions for hb gene expression. These failures in precise transcriptional control demonstrate the importance of cooperative DNA binding for embryonic patterning in vivo.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-8-418},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correct temporal and spatial gene expression during metazoan development relies on combinatorial interactions between different transcription factors. As a consequence, cis-regulatory elements often colocalize in clusters termed cis-regulatory modules. These may have requirements on organizational features such as spacing, order and helical phasing (periodic spacing) between binding sites. Due to the turning of the DNA helix, a small modification of the distance between a pair of sites may sometimes drastically disrupt function, while insertion of a full helical turn of DNA (10-11 bp) between cis elements may cause functionality to be restored. Recently, de novo motif discovery methods which incorporate organizational properties such as colocalization and order preferences have been developed, but there are no tools which incorporate periodic spacing into the model.
RESULTS: We have developed a web based motif discovery tool, HeliCis, which features a flexible model which allows de novo detection of motifs with periodic spacing. Depending on the parameter settings it may also be used for discovering colocalized motifs without periodicity or motifs separated by a fixed gap of known or unknown length. We show on simulated data that it can efficiently capture the synergistic effects of colocalization and periodic spacing to improve detection of weak DNA motifs. It provides a simple to use web interface which interactively visualizes the current settings and thereby makes it easy to understand the parameters and the model structure.
CONCLUSION: HeliCis provides simple and efficient de novo discovery of colocalized DNA motif pairs, with or without periodic spacing. Our evaluations show that it can detect weak periodic patterns which are not easily discovered using a sequential approach, i.e. first finding the binding sites and second analyzing the properties of their pairwise distances.},

Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging, transcription factor (TF) mutagenesis, and ChIP-exo mapping to determine how TFs dynamically search for and assemble on their cognate DNA target sites. We find that enhanceosome assembly is hierarchically ordered with kinetically favored Sox2 engaging the target DNA first, followed by assisted binding of Oct4. Sox2/Oct4 follow a trial-and-error sampling mechanism involving 84-97 events of 3D diffusion (3.3-3.7 s) interspersed with brief nonspecific collisions (0.75-0.9 s) before acquiring and dwelling at specific target DNA (12.0-14.6 s). Sox2 employs a 3D diffusion-dominated search mode facilitated by 1D sliding along open DNA to efficiently locate targets. Our findings also reveal fundamental aspects of gene and developmental regulation by fine-tuning TF dynamics and influence of the epigenome on target search parameters.},

The most rapid increase was in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising, which increased from \$2.1 billion (11.9\%) of total spending in 1997 to \$9.6 billion (32.0\%) of total spending in 2016. DTC prescription drug advertising increased from \$1.3 billion (79 000 ads) to \$6 billion (4.6 million ads [including 663 000 TV commercials]), with a shift toward advertising high-cost biologics and cancer immunotherapies. Pharmaceutical companies increased DTC marketing about diseases treated by their drugs with increases in disease awareness campaigns from 44 to 401 and in spending from \$177 million to \$430 million. DTC advertising for health services increased from \$542 million to \$2.9 billion, with the largest spending increases by hospitals, dental centers, cancer centers, mental health and addiction clinics, and medical services (eg, home health). DTC spending on advertising for laboratory tests (such as genetic testing) increased from \$75.4 million to \$82.6 million, although the number of ads increased more substantially (from 14 100 to 255 300), reflecting an increase in less expensive electronic media advertising. Marketing to health care professionals by pharmaceutical companies accounted for most promotional spending and increased from \$15.6 billion to \$20.3 billion, including \$5.6 billion for prescriber detailing, \$13.5 billion for free samples, \$979 million for direct physician payments (eg, speaking fees, meals) related to specific drugs, and \$59 million for disease education. Manufacturers of FDA-approved laboratory tests paid \$12.9 million to professionals in 2016. From 1997 through 2016, the number of consumer and professional drug promotional materials that companies submitted for FDA review increased from 34 182 to 97 252, while FDA violation letters for misleading drug marketing decreased from 156 to 11.

	abstract = {Most measures of interestingness for patterns of co-occurring events are based on data projections onto contingency tables for the events of primary interest. As an alternative, this article presents the first implementation of shrinkage logistic regression for large-scale pattern discovery, with an evaluation of its usefulness in real-world binary transaction data. Regression accounts for the impact of other covariates that may confound or otherwise distort associations. The application considered is international adverse drug reaction (ADR) surveillance, in which large collections of reports on suspected ADRs are screened for interesting reporting patterns worthy of clinical follow-up. Our results show that regression-based pattern discovery does offer practical advantages. Specifically it can eliminate false positives and false negatives due to other covariates. Furthermore, it identifies some established drug safety issues earlier than a measure based on contingency tables. While regression offers clear conceptual advantages, our results suggest that methods based on contingency tables will continue to play a key role in ADR surveillance, for two reasons: the failure of regression to identify some established drug safety concerns as early as the currently used measures, and the relative lack of transparency of the procedure to estimate the regression coefficients. This suggests shrinkage regression should be used in parallel to existing measures of interestingness in ADR surveillance and other large-scale pattern discovery applications.

	abstract = {Large observational data sets are a great asset to better understand the effects of medicines in clinical practice and, ultimately, improve patient care. For an empirical pattern in observational data to be of practical relevance, it should represent a substantial deviation from the null model. For the purpose of identifying such deviations, statistical significance tests are inadequate, as they do not on their own distinguish the magnitude of an effect from its data support. The observed-to-expected (OE) ratio on the other hand directly measures strength of association and is an intuitive basis to identify a range of patterns related to event rates, including pairwise associations, higher order interactions and temporal associations between events over time. It is sensitive to random fluctuations for rare events with low expected counts but statistical shrinkage can protect against spurious associations. Shrinkage OE ratios provide a simple but powerful framework for large-scale pattern discovery. In this article, we outline a range of patterns that are naturally viewed in terms of OE ratios and propose a straightforward and effective statistical shrinkage transformation that can be applied to any such ratio. The proposed approach retains emphasis on the practical relevance and transparency of highlighted patterns, while protecting against spurious associations.},

Doctors spending more time on administration had lower career satisfaction, even after controlling for income and other factors.

	abstract = {Context: Uninsured adults have less access to recommended care, receive poorer quality of care, and experience worse health outcomes than insured adults do. The potential health benefits of expanding insurance coverage for these adults may provide a strong rationale for reform. However, evidence of the adverse health effects of uninsurance has been largely based on observational studies with designs that do not support causal conclusions. Although recent research using more rigorous methods may offer a better understanding of this important subject, it has not been comprehensively reviewed. Methods: The clinical and economic literature since 2002 was systematically searched. New research contributions were reviewed and evaluated based on their methodological strength. Because the effectiveness of medical care varies considerably by clinical risk and across conditions, the consistency of study findings with clinical expectations was considered in their interpretation. Updated conclusions were formulated from the current body of research. Findings: The quality of research has improved significantly, as investigators have employed quasi-experimental designs with increasing frequency to address limitations of earlier research. Recent studies have found consistently positive and often significant effects of health insurance coverage on health across a range of outcomes. In particular, significant benefits of coverage have now been robustly demonstrated for adults with acute or chronic conditions for which there are effective treatments. Conclusions: Based on the evidence to date, the health consequences of uninsurance are real, vary in magnitude in a clinically consistent manner, strengthen the argument for universal coverage in the United States, and underscore the importance of evidence-based determinations in providing health care to a diverse population of adults.},

We found that within a market, for plans of otherwise equivalent design and controlling for issuer-specific pricing strategy, a plan with an extra-small network had a monthly premium that was 6.7 percent less expensive than that of a plan with a large network. Because narrow networks remain an important strategy available to insurance companies to offer lower-cost plans on health insurance Marketplaces, the success of health insurance coverage expansions may be tied to the successful implementation of narrow networks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mean phosphorous:nitrogen (P:N) ratios and relationships of P:N ratios with the growth rate of organisms indicate a surprising similarity among and within microbial species, plants, and insect herbivores. To reveal the cellular mechanisms underling this similarity, the macromolecular composition of seven microorganisms and the effect of specific growth rate (SGR) on RNA:protein ratio, the number of ribosomes, and peptide elongation rate (PER) were analyzed under different conditions of exponential growth.
RESULTS: It was found that P:N ratios calculated from RNA and protein contents in these particular organisms were in the same range as the mean ratios reported for diverse organisms and had similar positive relationships with growth rate, consistent with the growth-rate hypothesis. The efficiency of protein synthesis in microorganisms is estimated as the number of active ribosomes required for the incorporation of one amino acid into the synthesized protein. This parameter is calculated as the SGR:PER ratio. Experimental and theoretical evidence indicated that the requirement of ribosomes for protein synthesis is proportional to the RNA:protein ratio. The constant of proportionality had the same values for all organisms, and was derived mechanistically from the characteristics of the protein-synthesis machinery of the cell (the number of nucleotides per ribosome, the average masses of nucleotides and amino acids, the fraction of ribosomal RNA in the total RNA, and the fraction of active ribosomes). Impairment of the growth conditions decreased the RNA:protein ratio and increased the overall efficiency of protein synthesis in the microorganisms.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the decrease in RNA:protein and estimated P:N ratios with decrease in the growth rate of the microorganism is a consequence of an increased overall efficiency of protein synthesis in the cell resulting from activation of the general stress response and increased transcription of cellular maintenance genes at the expense of growth related genes. The strong link between P:N stoichiometry, RNA:protein ratio, ribosomal requirement for protein synthesis, and growth rate of microorganisms indicated by the study could be used to characterize the N and P economy of complex ecosystems such as soils and the oceans.},

We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.},

Among these, monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) and methylation of histone H3 on lysines 36 (H3K36me2/3) and 79 (H3K79me2/3) correlate positively with gene expression. By measuring the progression of the transcriptional machinery along genes within live cells, we now report that H2B monoubiquitylation occurs cotranscriptionally and accurately reflects the advance of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In contrast, H3K36me3 and H3K79me2 are less dynamic and represent Pol II movement less faithfully. High-resolution ChIP-seq reveals that H2Bub1 levels are selectively reduced at exons and decrease in an exon-dependent stepwise manner toward the 3' end of genes. Exonic depletion of H2Bub1 in gene bodies is highly correlated with Pol II pausing at exons, suggesting elongation rate changes associated with intron-exon structure. In support of this notion, H2Bub1 levels were found to be significantly correlated with transcription elongation rates measured in various cell lines. Overall, our data shed light on the organization of H2Bub1 within transcribed genes and single out H2Bub1 as a reliable marker for ongoing transcription elongation.},

The resulting macroscopic domains have been mainly characterized by their levels of gene products. However, the establishment of such patterns results from differences in the dynamics of microscopic events in individual cells such as transcription. It is unclear how these microscopic decisions lead to macroscopic patterns, as measurements in fixed tissue cannot access the underlying transcriptional dynamics. In vivo transcriptional dynamics have long been approached in single-celled organisms, but never in a multicellular developmental context. Here, we directly address how boundaries of gene expression emerge in the Drosophila embryo by measuring the absolute number of actively transcribing polymerases in real time in individual nuclei. Specifically, we show that the formation of a boundary cannot be quantitatively explained by the rate of mRNA production in each cell, but instead requires amplification of the dynamic range of the expression boundary. This amplification is accomplished by nuclei randomly adopting active or inactive states of transcription, leading to a collective effect where the fraction of active nuclei is modulated in space. Thus, developmental patterns are not just the consequence of reproducible transcriptional dynamics in individual nuclei, but are the result of averaging expression over space and time.},

Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely, the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation, accounting for more than half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell.

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.270},
	abstract = {Large scale surveys in mammalian tissue culture cells suggest that the protein expressed at the median abundance is present at 8,000-16,000 molecules per cell and that differences in mRNA expression between genes explain only 10-40\% of the differences in protein levels. We find, however, that these surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances and the relative importance of transcription. Using individual measurements for 61 housekeeping proteins to rescale whole proteome data from Schwanhausser et al. (2011), we find that the median protein detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per cell and that our corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher correlation with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein data. In addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA and protein abundances using direct experimental measurements of these errors. The resulting analysis suggests that mRNA levels explain at least 56\% of the differences in protein abundance for the 4,212 genes detected by Schwanhausser et al. (2011), though because one major source of error could not be estimated the true percent contribution should be higher. We also employed a second, independent strategy to determine the contribution of mRNA levels to protein expression. We show that the variance in translation rates directly measured by ribosome profiling is only 12\% of that inferred by Schwanhausser et al. (2011), and that the measured and inferred translation rates correlate poorly (R(2) = 0.13). Based on this, our second strategy suggests that mRNA levels explain ∼81\% of the variance in protein levels. We also determined the percent contributions of transcription, RNA degradation, translation and protein degradation to the variance in protein abundances using both of our strategies. While the magnitudes of the two estimates vary, they both suggest that transcription plays a more important role than the earlier studies implied and translation a much smaller role. Finally, the above estimates only apply to those genes whose mRNA and protein expression was detected. Based on a detailed analysis by Hebenstreit et al. (2012), we estimate that approximately 40\% of genes in a given cell within a population express no mRNA. Since there can be no translation in the absence of mRNA, we argue that differences in translation rates can play no role in determining the expression levels for the ∼40\% of genes that are non-expressed.},

The study shows that the transcript and protein levels do not correlate well unless a gene-specific RNA-to-protein (RTP) conversion factor independent of the tissue type is introduced, thus significantly enhancing the predictability of protein copy numbers from RNA levels. The results show that the RTP ratio varies significantly with a few hundred copies per mRNA molecule for some genes to several hundred thousands of protein copies per mRNA molecule for others. In conclusion, our data suggest that transcriptome analysis can be used as a tool to predict the protein copy numbers per cell, thus forming an attractive link between the field of genomics and proteomics.},

	abstract = {The Notch signaling pathway comprises multiple ligands that are used in distinct biological contexts. In principle, different ligands could activate distinct target programs in signal-receiving cells, but it is unclear how such ligand discrimination could occur. Here, we show that cells use dynamics to discriminate signaling by the ligands Dll1 and Dll4 through the Notch1 receptor. Quantitative single-cell imaging revealed that Dll1 activates Notch1 in discrete, frequency-modulated pulses that specifically upregulate the Notch target gene Hes1. By contrast, Dll4 activates Notch1 in a sustained, amplitude-modulated manner that predominantly upregulates Hey1 and HeyL. Ectopic expression of Dll1 or Dll4 in chick neural crest produced opposite effects on myogenic differentiation, showing that ligand discrimination can occur in vivo. Finally, analysis of chimeric ligands suggests that ligand-receptor clustering underlies dynamic encoding of ligand identity. The ability of the pathway to utilize ligands as distinct communication channels has implications for diverse Notch-dependent processes.},

	abstract = {The c-myc gene is translocated to one of the immunoglobulin genes in Burkitt's lymphoma resulting in deregulated expression of c-myc. Several enhancers have been shown to be important for expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Four enhancer regions (murine-hypersensitive sites (MHS) 1, 2, 3, and 4) located 3' of the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain gene play a role in activating expression of the translocated c-myc gene. The enhancer regions also result in a shift in transcriptional initiation from the P2 promoter to P1 that is characteristic of the translocated c-myc allele. We found that the most 3' enhancer region (MHS4) activated the c-myc promoter by 46-fold in the Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, and it was the most active enhancer in these cells. The addition of enhancer regions MHS1,2 and 3 to MHS4 increased c-myc transcription by an additional 3-fold and resulted in the full promoter shift from P2 to P1. By deletion analysis of enhancer region MHS4, we located a region that was critical for the transcriptional activity of MHS4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis revealed that NF-kappaB/Rel family members bound to this region. Mutation of the NF-kappaB binding site abolished both the enhancer activity and the promoter shift activity of MHS4. An active NF-kappaB site was also identified in the human HS4 enhancer. Inhibition of c-myc promoter activity driven by the immunoglobulin enhancers was observed with expression of a super-repressor IkappaBalpha construct. These results indicate that the NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors play an important role in the deregulation of the translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and suggest that interference with NF-kappaB function may represent a new approach to the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma.},

	abstract = {In murine plasmacytoma and human Burkitt's lymphoma cells, one allele of c-myc is translocated into one of the immunoglobulin loci, resulting in a characteristic pattern of deregulated c-myc transcription. Translocation events between c-myc and the IgH locus segregate c-myc and the IgH intron enhancer to different reciprocal products in all plasmacytomas and in most Burkitt's lymphoma cells, suggesting that an additional element(s) capable of affecting c-myc expression over a large and variable distance must exist in the IgH locus. The region 3' of the IgH C alpha gene contains four tissue-specific and cell stage-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs), two of which map to the late B cell-specific 3' C alpha enhancer. We report here that DNA sequences comprising the two other 3' C alpha HSs contain potential protein-binding motifs for trans-activators commonly associated with immunoglobulin enhancers and that these sites can function as cell stage-specific enhancers in transient B cell assays. A DNA fragment containing all four HSs (HS1234) synergistically activates c-myc transcription in plasmacytoma and Burkitt's lymphoma cells in transient assays and induces high-level transcription, a promoter shift from P2 to P1, and an increase in readthrough transcription in stable transfections. Furthermore, plasmacytoma clones stably transfected with a HS1234-linked c-myc construct express c-myc in a position-independent, copy number-dependent manner. These results suggest that HS1234 may function as a locus control region (LCR), deregulating c-myc expression in t(15;12) plasmacytomas, as well as potentially contributing to aspects of normal IgH chain expression.},

Most of the increased c-myc expression is from the P1 promoter, which is normally a minor promoter. How the P1 promoter is activated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers is not understood. We identified a YY1 site in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene HS3 enhancer, which increased c-myc P1 promoter activity, and a MARE site, which decreased c-myc P1 activity. Small Maf proteins bound to the MARE site both in vitro and in vivo, recruited histone deacetylase 2, and resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the c-myc promoter region. In contrast, YY1 recruited CBP and increased histone acetylation at the c-myc promoter. Rb interacts with YY1 to prevent DNA binding in normal B cells, but no significant interaction with YY1 was detected in Burkitt's cells, and binding of YY1 to the HS3 enhancer was observed by chromatin immunoprecipitaton. Increased expression of MafK and/or decreased expression of YY1 by silencing RNA downregulated endogenous c-myc mRNA levels and increased the sensitivity of the cells to doxorubicin. Mutation of the major active sites (nuclear factor-kappa B and YY1) in the enhancers prevented c-myc activation.},

Polyclonal antisera to fusion proteins containing the MyoD1 sequence show that MyoD1 is a phosphoprotein present in the nuclei of proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes but not expressed in 10T1/2 fibroblasts or other nonmuscle cell types. Functional domains of the MyoD1 protein were analyzed by site-directed deletional mutagenesis of the MyoD1 cDNA. Deletion of a highly basic region (residues 102 to 135) interferes with both nuclear localization and induction of myogenesis. Deletion of a short region (residues 143 to 162) that is similar to a conserved region in the c-Myc family of proteins eliminates the ability of the MyoD1 protein to initiate myogenesis but does not alter nuclear localization. Deletions of regions spanning the remainder of MyoD1 did not affect nuclear localization and did not inhibit myogenesis. Furthermore, expression of only 68 amino acids of MyoD1, containing the basic and the Myc similarity domains, is sufficient to activate myogenesis in stably transfected 10T1/2 cells. Genetic analysis maps the MyoD1 gene to mouse chromosome 7 and human chromosome 11.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized the field of cancer genetics, but the causal links between increased genetic risk and onset/progression of disease processes remain to be identified. Here we report the first step in such an endeavor for prostate cancer. We provide a comprehensive annotation of the 77 known risk loci, based upon highly correlated variants in biologically relevant chromatin annotations--we identified 727 such potentially functional SNPs. We also provide a detailed account of possible protein disruption, microRNA target sequence disruption and regulatory response element disruption of all correlated SNPs at r(2) ≥ 0.88\%. 88\% of the 727 SNPs fall within putative enhancers, and many alter critical residues in the response elements of transcription factors known to be involved in prostate biology. We define as risk enhancers those regions with enhancer chromatin biofeatures in prostate-derived cell lines with prostate-cancer correlated SNPs. To aid the identification of these enhancers, we performed genomewide ChIP-seq for H3K27-acetylation, a mark of actively engaged enhancers, as well as the transcription factor TCF7L2. We analyzed in depth three variants in risk enhancers, two of which show significantly altered androgen sensitivity in LNCaP cells. This includes rs4907792, that is in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.91) with an eQTL for NUDT11 (on the X chromosome) in prostate tissue, and rs10486567, the index SNP in intron 3 of the JAZF1 gene on chromosome 7. Rs4907792 is within a critical residue of a strong consensus androgen response element that is interrupted in the protective allele, resulting in a 56\% decrease in its androgen sensitivity, whereas rs10486567 affects both NKX3-1 and FOXA-AR motifs where the risk allele results in a 39\% increase in basal activity and a 28\% fold-increase in androgen stimulated enhancer activity. Identification of such enhancer variants and their potential target genes represents a preliminary step in connecting risk to disease process.},

Extensive simulations showed that in contrast to current estimates from GWAS summary statistics, the variance-component approach partitions heritability accurately under a wide range of complex-disease architectures. Across the 11 diseases DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) from 217 cell types spanned 16\% of imputed SNPs (and 24\% of genotyped SNPs) but explained an average of 79\% (SE = 8\%) of hg(2) from imputed SNPs (5.1× enrichment; p = 3.7 × 10(-17)) and 38\% (SE = 4\%) of hg(2) from genotyped SNPs (1.6× enrichment, p = 1.0 × 10(-4)). Further enrichment was observed at enhancer DHSs and cell-type-specific DHSs. In contrast, coding variants, which span 1\% of the genome, explained {\textless}10\% of hg(2) despite having the highest enrichment. We replicated these findings but found no significant contribution from rare coding variants in independent schizophrenia cohorts genotyped on GWAS and exome chips.

I will then consider direct evidence from single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions, or deletions but also larger genomic rearrangements such as duplications, deletions, translocations, and inversions of specific enhancers to demonstrate how they have the ability to impact enhancer activity of disease genes including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Considering that the scientific community only fairly recently has begun to focus its attention on "enhancer malfunction" in disease, I propose that multiple new enhancer-regulated and disease-relevant processes will be uncovered in the near future that will constitute the mechanistic basis for novel therapeutic avenues.},

Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized. Here we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration. We find a coordinated downregulation of synaptic plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1. Human regions orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune-cell-specific enhancer signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci, while decreasing-level enhancer orthologues show fetal-brain-specific enhancer activity. Notably, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in increasing-level enhancer orthologues, implicating immune processes in AD predisposition. Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking protein-altering variants, and implicate additional loci that do not reach genome-wide significance. Our results reveal new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and establish the mouse as a useful model for functional studies of AD regulatory regions.},

	abstract = {Notch signaling regulates many cellular processes during development and adult tissue renewal. Upon ligand binding, Notch receptors undergo ectodomain shedding followed by γ-secretase-mediated release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and associates with the DNA binding protein CSL [CBF1/RBPjκ/Su(H)/Lag1] to activate gene expression. Mammalian cells contain four Notch receptors that can have both redundant and specific activities. To monitor activation of specific Notch paralogs in live cells and in real time, we developed luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) reporters for NICD-CSL association and validated them as a specific, robust, and sensitive assay system that enables structure-function and pharmacodynamic analyses. Detailed kinetic analyses of various mechanistic aspects of Notch signaling, including nuclear translocation and inhibition of the activities of γ-secretase and ADAM metalloproteases, as well as agonist- and ligand-dependent activation, were conducted in live cells. These experiments showed that Notch-LCI is an effective approach for characterizing modulators that target Notch signaling and for studying pathway dynamics in normal and disease contexts.},

	abstract = {Dynamic activity of signaling pathways, such as Notch, is vital to achieve correct development and homeostasis. However, most studies assess output many hours or days after initiation of signaling, once the outcome has been consolidated. Here we analyze genome-wide changes in transcript levels, binding of the Notch pathway transcription factor, CSL [Suppressor of Hairless, Su(H), in Drosophila], and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) immediately following a short pulse of Notch stimulation. A total of 154 genes showed significant differential expression (DE) over time, and their expression profiles stratified into 14 clusters based on the timing, magnitude, and direction of DE. E(spl) genes were the most rapidly upregulated, with Su(H), Pol II, and transcript levels increasing within 5-10 minutes. Other genes had a more delayed response, the timing of which was largely unaffected by more prolonged Notch activation. Neither Su(H) binding nor poised Pol II could fully explain the differences between profiles. Instead, our data indicate that regulatory interactions, driven by the early-responding E(spl)bHLH genes, are required. Proposed cross-regulatory relationships were validated in vivo and in cell culture, supporting the view that feed-forward repression by E(spl)bHLH/Hes shapes the response of late-responding genes. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Hes genes are responsible for co-ordinating the Notch response of a wide spectrum of other targets, explaining the critical functions these key regulators play in many developmental and disease contexts.},

MAM interacts directly with CDK8 and can cause it to localize to subnuclear foci. Purified recombinant CycC:CDK8 phosphorylates the Notch ICD within the TAD and PEST domains, and expression of CycC:CDK8 strongly enhances Notch ICD hyperphosphorylation and PEST-dependent degradation by the Fbw7/Sel10 ubiquitin ligase in vivo. Point mutations affecting conserved Ser residues within the ICD PEST motif prevent hyperphosphorylation by CycC:CDK8 and stabilize the ICD in vivo. These findings suggest a role for MAM and CycC:CDK8 in the turnover of the Notch enhancer complex at target genes.},

Gro mediates repression by multiple molecular mechanisms, depending on the regulatory context. Because Gro is a broadly expressed nuclear factor, whereas its repressor partners display restricted temporal and spatial distribution, it was presumed that this corepressor played permissive rather than instructive roles in development. However, a wide range of studies demonstrates that this is not the case. Gro can sense and integrate many cellular inputs to modulate the expression of variety of genes, making it a versatile corepressor with crucial instructive roles in development and signaling.},

	abstract = {The engrailed homeoprotein is a dominantly acting or 'active' transcriptional repressor both in cultured cells and in vivo. When retargeted via a homeodomain swap to the endogenous fushi tarazu gene (ftz), it actively represses it, resulting in a ftz mutant phenocopy. We have mapped functional regions of engrailed using this in vivo repression assay. In addition to a region containing an active repression domain identified in cell culture assays (K. Han and J. L. Manley (1993) EMBO J. 12, 2723-2733), we find that two evolutionarily conserved regions contribute to activity. The one of these that does not flank the HD is particularly crucial to repression activity in vivo. We find that this domain is present not only in all engrailed-class homeoproteins but also in all known members of several other classes, including goosecoid, Nk1, Nk2 and msh. Thus engrailed's active repression function in vivo is dependent on a highly conserved interaction that was established early in the evolution of the homeobox gene superfamily. We further show using rescue transgenes that the widely conserved in vivo repression domain is required for the normal function of engrailed in the embryo.},

The extensive overlap of individual binding sites creates a composite element that ensures that the enhancer operates as a single unit of regulation. The absence of major protein-protein interfaces between the transcription factors suggests that cooperative binding occurs through a combination of binding-induced conformational changes in DNA structure and specific interactions with coactivator proteins such as CBP/p300.

Brd4-dependent JMJD6 recruitment on A-PEs mediates erasure of H4R3me(2(s)), which is directly read by 7SK snRNA, and decapping/demethylation of 7SK snRNA, ensuring the dismissal of the 7SK snRNA/HEXIM inhibitory complex. The interactions of both JMJD6 and Brd4 with the P-TEFb complex permit its activation and pause release of regulated coding genes.

The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations.

By measuring the biochemical affinity of target enhancers in these classes in vitro and genome-wide chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq, we found that the occupancy of target sequences by Bcd is not primarily determined by Bcd binding sites, but by chromatin context. Bcd drives an open chromatin state at a subset of its targets. Our data support a model where Bcd influences chromatin structure to gain access to concentration-sensitive targets at high concentrations, while concentration-insensitive targets are found in more accessible chromatin and are bound at low concentrations. This may be a common property of developmental transcription factors that must gain early access to their target enhancers while the chromatin state of the genome is being remodeled during large-scale transitions in the gene regulatory landscape.},

In contrast to canonical models, we observed that Bicoid binds to DNA with a rapid off rate throughout the embryo such that its average occupancy at target loci is on-rate-dependent. We further observed Bicoid forming transient “hubs” of locally high density that facilitate binding as factor levels drop, including in the posterior, where we observed Bicoid binding despite vanishingly low protein levels. We propose that localized modulation of transcription factor on rates via clustering provides a general mechanism to facilitate binding to low-affinity targets and that this may be a prevalent feature of other developmental transcription factors.},

	abstract = {Despite their canonical two-fold symmetry, nucleosomes in biological contexts are often asymmetric: functionalized with post-translational modifications (PTMs), substituted with histone variants, and even lacking H2A/H2B dimers. Here we show that the Widom 601 nucleosome positioning sequence can produce hexasomes in a specific orientation on DNA, providing a useful tool for interrogating chromatin enzymes and allowing for the generation of nucleosomes with precisely defined asymmetry. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that the Chd1 chromatin remodeler fromSaccharomyces cerevisiaerequires H2A/H2B on the entry side for sliding, and thus, unlike the back-and-forth sliding observed for nucleosomes, Chd1 shifts hexasomes unidirectionally. Chd1 takes part in chromatin reorganization surrounding transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and using asymmetric nucleosomes we show that ubiquitin-conjugated H2B on the entry side stimulates nucleosome sliding by Chd1. We speculate that biased nucleosome and hexasome sliding due to asymmetry contributes to the packing of arrays observed in vivo.},

However, mitotic bookmarking remains largely unexplored in most stem cell types, and its functional relevance for cell fate decisions remains unclear. Here we screened for mitotic chromosome binding within the pluripotency network of embryonic stem (ES) cells and show that SOX2 and OCT4 remain bound to mitotic chromatin through their respective DNA-binding domains. Dynamic characterization using photobleaching-based methods and single-molecule imaging revealed quantitatively similar specific DNA interactions, but different nonspecific DNA interactions, of SOX2 and OCT4 with mitotic chromatin. Using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) to assess the genome-wide distribution of SOX2 on mitotic chromatin, we demonstrate the bookmarking activity of SOX2 on a small set of genes. Finally, we investigated the function of SOX2 mitotic bookmarking in cell fate decisions and show that its absence at the M-G1 transition impairs pluripotency maintenance and abrogates its ability to induce neuroectodermal differentiation but does not affect reprogramming efficiency toward induced pluripotent stem cells. Our study demonstrates the mitotic bookmarking property of SOX2 and reveals its functional importance in pluripotency maintenance and ES cell differentiation.},

Responses to such forces can reveal details of the load-dependent kinetics of transcriptional elongation and pausing. Traditionally, the bacterial form of RNAP from E. coli has served as a model for the study of transcriptional elongation using optical traps. However, it is now feasible to perform optical trapping experiments using the eukaryotic polymerase, RNAPII, as well.

However, whether cohesin can translocate along DNA is unknown. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that cohesin can diffuse rapidly on DNA in a manner consistent with topological entrapment and can pass over some DNA-bound proteins and nucleosomes but is constrained in its movement by transcription and DNA-bound CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). These results indicate that cohesin can be positioned in the genome by moving along DNA, that transcription can provide directionality to these movements, that CTCF functions as a boundary element for moving cohesin, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that cohesin spatially organizes the genome via loop extrusion.},

Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we reveal that the tetranucleosomes-on-a-string appears as a stable secondary structure during hierarchical organization of chromatin fibers. The stability of the tetranucleosomal unit is attenuated by histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) in vitro. Consistent with in vitro observations, our genome-wide analysis further shows that FACT facilitates gene transcription by destabilizing the tetranucleosomal unit of chromatin fibers in yeast. Additionally, we found that the linker histone H1 not only enhances the stability but also facilitates the folding and unfolding kinetics of the outer nucleosomal wrap. Our study demonstrates that the tetranucleosome is a regulatory structural unit of chromatin fibers beyond the nucleosome and provides crucial mechanistic insights into the structure and dynamics of chromatin fibers during gene transcription.},

Region sigma 3.2, which contains a loop blocking the RNA exit channel, was a major pausing determinant. We also obtained evidence for RNA backtracking during abortive initial transcription and for additional pausing prior to escape.

Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular the chromatin remodeler CHD4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via preformed and active sub-modules.

To address these issues, we developed a single molecule system using TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy and purified human transcription factors, which allows us to visualize transcriptional activity at individual template molecules. We see that stable interactions between polymerase II (Pol II) and a heteroduplex DNA template do not depend on general transcription factors; however, transcriptional activity is highly dependent upon TATA-binding protein, TFIIB and TFIIF. We also found that subsets of general transcription factors and Pol II can form stable complexes that are precursors for functional transcription complexes upon addition of the remaining factors and DNA. Ultimately we found that Pol II, TATA-binding protein, TFIIB and TFIIF can form a quaternary complex in the absence of promoter DNA, indicating that a stable network of interactions exists between these proteins independent of promoter DNA.

Single-molecule live-cell imaging has, therefore, emerged as a complementary approach capable of circumventing these limitations. By observing sequences of molecular events in real time as they occur in their native context, imaging has the power to derive cause-and-effect relationships and quantitative kinetics to build predictive models of transcription. Ongoing progress in fluorescence imaging technology has brought new microscopes and labeling technologies that now make it possible to visualize and quantify the transcription process with single-molecule resolution in living cells and animals.

Here we describe a technique based on single molecule Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization (smFISH) to measure transcription and degradation rates in intact mammalian tissues. The technique is based on dual-color libraries targeting the introns and exons of the genes of interest, enabling visualization and quantification of both nascent and mature mRNA. We present a software, TransQuant, that facilitates quantifying these rates from smFISH images. Our approach enables assessment of both transcription and degradation rates of any gene of interest while controlling for the inherent heterogeneity of intact tissues.},

By single-molecule visualization of the dynamic interplay between coding and non-coding transcription at the GAL locus in living yeast cells, we show that antisense GAL10 ncRNA transcription can switch between functional and spurious under different conditions. During galactose induction, GAL10 sense transcription occurs in short stochastic bursts, which are unaffected by transcription of antisense GAL10 ncRNA, even when both are present simultaneously at the same locus. In contrast, when GAL10 is not induced, ncRNA transcription is critical to prevent transcriptional leakage of GAL1 and GAL10. Suppression of ncRNA transcription by strand-specific CRISPR/dCas9 results in transcriptional leakage of the inducer GAL1, leading to a more sensitive transcription activation threshold, an alteration of metabolic switching, and a fitness defect in competition experiments.},

The development of novel single-cell sequencing and imaging techniques, as well as a better exploitation of currently available single-molecule imaging techniques, provides an avenue to interrogate the process of transcription and its dynamics in cells by quantifying the number of RNA polymerases engaged in the transcription of a gene (or equivalently the number of nascent RNAs) at a given moment in time. In this paper, we propose that measurements of the cell-to-cell variability in the number of nascent RNAs provide a mostly unexplored method for deciphering mechanisms of transcription initiation in cells. We propose a simple kinetic model of transcription initiation and elongation from which we calculate nascent RNA copy-number fluctuations. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we test our theory against published nascent RNA data for twelve constitutively expressed yeast genes. Rather than transcription being initiated through a single rate limiting step, as it had been previously proposed, our single-cell analysis reveals the presence of at least two rate limiting steps. Surprisingly, half of the genes analyzed have nearly identical rates of transcription initiation, suggesting a common mechanism. Our analytical framework can be used to extract quantitative information about dynamics of transcription from single-cell sequencing data, as well as from single-molecule imaging and electron micrographs of fixed cells, and provides the mathematical means to exploit the quantitative power of these technologies.},

: The human leukaemia virus HTLV-1 expresses essential accessory genes that manipulate the expression, splicing and transport of viral mRNAs.  Two of these genes,taxandhbz, also promote proliferation of the infected cell, and both genes are thought to contribute to oncogenesis in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma.  The regulation of HTLV-1 proviral latency is not understood. tax,on the proviral plus strand, is usually silent in freshly-isolated cells, whereas the minus-strand-encodedhbzgene is persistently expressed at a low level.  However, the persistently activated host immune response to Tax indicates frequent expression oftaxin vivo. Methods: We used single-molecule RNA-FISH to quantify the expression of HTLV-1 transcripts at the single-cell level in a total of {\textgreater}19,000 cells from five T-cell clones, naturally infected with HTLV-1, isolated by limiting dilution from peripheral blood of HTLV-1-infected subjects. Results: We found strong heterogeneity both within and between clones in the expression of the proviral plus-strand (detected by hybridization to thetaxgene) and the minus-strand (hbzgene). Both genes are transcribed in bursts;taxexpression is enhanced in the absence ofhbz, whilehbzexpression increased in cells with hightaxexpression. Surprisingly, we found thathbzexpression is strongly associated with the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, independent oftaxexpression.  Contrary to current belief,hbzis not expressed in all cells at all times, even within one clone.  Inhbz-positive cells, the abundance ofhbztranscripts showed a very strong positive linear correlation with nuclear volume.Conclusions: The occurrence of intense, intermittent plus-strand gene bursts in independent primary HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones from unrelated individuals strongly suggests that the HTLV-1 plus-strand is expressed in bursts in vivo.  Our results offer an explanation for the paradoxical correlations observed between the host immune response and HTLV-1 transcription.},

We outline an approach that begins with a broad survey of genome-wide, high-throughput datasets to identify potential lncRNA candidates and then narrow the focus on specific methods that are well suited to interrogate the transcripts of interest more closely. This involves the use of imaging-based strategies to validate these candidates and observe the behaviors of these transcripts at single molecule resolution in individual cells.

Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular polarization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in polarization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This led to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association of active transcription regulatory elements (TREs) with DNAse I hypersensitivity (DHS[+]) and an 'open' local chromatin configuration has long been known. However, the 3D topography of TREs within the nuclear landscape of individual cells in relation to their active or inactive status has remained elusive. Here, we explored the 3D nuclear topography of active and inactive TREs in the context of a recently proposed model for a functionally defined nuclear architecture, where an active and an inactive nuclear compartment (ANC-INC) form two spatially co-aligned and functionally interacting networks.
RESULTS: Using 3D structured illumination microscopy, we performed 3D FISH with differently labeled DNA probe sets targeting either sites with DHS[+], apparently active TREs, or DHS[-] sites harboring inactive TREs. Using an in-house image analysis tool, DNA targets were quantitatively mapped on chromatin compaction shaped 3D nuclear landscapes. Our analyses present evidence for a radial 3D organization of chromatin domain clusters (CDCs) with layers of increasing chromatin compaction from the periphery to the CDC core. Segments harboring active TREs are significantly enriched at the decondensed periphery of CDCs with loops penetrating into interchromatin compartment channels, constituting the ANC. In contrast, segments lacking active TREs (DHS[-]) are enriched toward the compacted interior of CDCs (INC).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results add further evidence in support of the ANC-INC network model. The different 3D topographies of DHS[+] and DHS[-] sites suggest positional changes of TREs between the ANC and INC depending on their functional state, which might provide additional protection against an inappropriate activation. Our finding of a structural organization of CDCs based on radially arranged layers of different chromatin compaction levels indicates a complex higher-order chromatin organization beyond a dichotomic classification of chromatin into an 'open,' active and 'closed,' inactive state.},

Here, we harnessed single-molecule footprinting to quantify distinct steps of initiation in vivo throughout the Drosophila genome. This identifies the impact of promoter structure on initiation dynamics in relation to nucleosomal occupancy. Additionally, perturbation of transcriptional initiation reveals an unexpectedly high turnover of polymerases at paused promoters-an observation confirmed at the level of nascent RNAs. These observations argue that absence of elongation is largely caused by premature termination rather than by stable polymerase stalling. In support of this non-processive model, we observe that induction of the paused heat shock promoter depends on continuous initiation.

Importantly, MBD2 functions within CpG islands that contain 100s to 1000s of potential binding sites. Since NuRD physically rearranges nucleosomes, the dynamic mobility of this complex is directly related to function. In these studies, we use NMR and single-molecule atomic force microscopy and fluorescence imaging to study DNA binding dynamics of MBD2. Single-molecule fluorescence tracking on DNA tightropes containing regions with CpG-rich and CpG-free regions reveals that MBD2 carries out unbiased 1D diffusion on CpG-rich DNA but subdiffusion on CpG-free DNA. In contrast, the protein stably and statically binds to methylated CpG (mCpG) regions. The intrinsically disordered region (IDR) on MBD2 both reduces exchange between mCpG sites along the DNA as well as the dissociation from DNA, acting like an anchor that restricts the dynamic mobility of the MBD domain. Unexpectedly, MBD2 binding to methylated CpGs induces DNA bending that is augmented by the IDR region of the protein. These results suggest that MBD2 targets NuRD to unmethylated or methylated CpG islands where its distinct dynamic binding modes help maintain open or closed chromatin, respectively.},

However, the precise means by which p53 dynamically interacts with TFIID to facilitate assembly on target gene promoters remains elusive. To address this key issue, we have undertaken an integrated approach involving single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemistry. Our real-time single-molecule imaging data demonstrate that TFIID alone binds poorly to native p53 target promoters. p53 unlocks TFIID's ability to bind DNA by stabilizing TFIID contacts with both the core promoter and a region within p53's response element. Analysis of single-molecule dissociation kinetics reveals that TFIID interacts with promoters via transient and prolonged DNA binding modes that are each regulated by p53. Importantly, our structural work reveals that TFIID's conversion to a rearranged DNA binding conformation is enhanced in the presence of DNA and p53. Notably, TFIID's interaction with DNA induces p53 to rapidly dissociate, which likely leads to additional rounds of p53-mediated recruitment of other basal factors. Collectively, these findings indicate that p53 dynamically escorts and loads TFIID onto its target promoters.},

CTCF recruits BRD2 to co-bound sites whereas BRD2 is dispensable for CTCF occupancy. Disruption of a CTCF/BRD2-occupied element positioned between two unrelated genes enables regulatory influence to spread from one gene to another, suggesting that CTCF and BRD2 form a transcriptional boundary. Accordingly, single-molecule mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) reveals that, upon site-specific CTCF disruption or BRD2 depletion, expression of the two genes becomes increasingly correlated. HiC shows that BRD2 depletion weakens boundaries co-occupied by CTCF and BRD2, but not those that lack BRD2.

	abstract = {In many cases, initiation is rate limiting to transcription. This due in part to the multiple cycles of abortive transcription that delay promoter escape and the transition from initiation to elongation. Pausing of transcription in initiation can further delay promoter escape. The previously hypothesized pausing in initiation was confirmed by two recent studies from Duchi et al.1and from Lerner, Chung et al.2In both studies, pausing is attributed to a lack of forward translocation of the nascent transcript during initiation. However, the two works report on different pausing mechanisms. Duchi et al. report on pausing that occurs during initiation predominantly on-pathway of transcript synthesis. Lerner, Chung et al. report on pausing during initiation as a result of RNAP backtracking, which is off-pathway to transcript synthesis. Here, we discuss these studies, together with additional experimental results from single-molecule FRET focusing on a specific distance within the transcription bubble. We show that the results of these studies are complementary to each other and are consistent with a model involving two types of pauses in initiation: a short-lived pause that occurs in the translocation of a 6-mer nascent transcript and a long-lived pause that occurs as a result of 1-2 nucleotide backtracking of a 7-mer transcript.},

This is surprising, as defective gene silencing underlies developmental abnormalities and disease. Here we delineate the sequence and functional contribution of transcriptional repression mechanisms at high temporal resolution. Inducible entry of the NuRD-interacting transcriptional regulator Ikaros into mouse pre-B cell nuclei triggered immediate binding to target gene promoters. Rapid RNAP2 eviction, transcriptional shutdown, nucleosome invasion, and reduced transcriptional activator binding required chromatin remodeling by NuRD-associated Mi2beta/CHD4, but were independent of HDAC activity. Histone deacetylation occurred after transcriptional repression. Nevertheless, HDAC activity contributed to stable gene silencing. Hence, high resolution mapping of transcriptional repression reveals complex and interdependent mechanisms that underpin rapid transitions between transcriptional states, and elucidates the temporal order, functional role and mechanistic separation of NuRD-associated enzymatic activities.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is crucial for neuronal activity-dependent processes that govern neuronal circuit formation and synaptic plasticity. An intriguing question is how neuronal activity influences the spatiotemporal interactions between transcription factors and their target sites. Here, using a single-molecule imaging technique, we investigated the activity dependence of DNA binding and dissociation events of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), a principal factor in activity-dependent transcription, in mouse cortical neurons. To visualize CREB at the single-molecule level, fluorescent-tagged CREB in living dissociated cortical neurons was observed by highly inclined and laminated optical sheet microscopy. We found that a significant fraction of CREB spots resided in the restricted locations in the nucleus for several seconds (dissociation rate constant: 0.42 s-1). In contrast, two mutant CREBs, which cannot bind to the cAMP-response element, scarcely exhibited long-term residence. To test the possibility that CREB dynamics depends on neuronal activity, pharmacological treatments and an optogenetic method involving channelrhodopsin-2 were applied to cultured cortical neurons. Increased neuronal activity did not appear to influence the residence time of CREB spots, but markedly increased the number of restricted locations (hot spots) where CREB spots frequently resided with long residence times ({\textgreater}1 s). These results suggest that neuronal activity promotes CREB-dependent transcription by increasing the frequency of CREB binding to highly localized genome locations.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is known to regulate gene expression in neuronal activity-dependent processes. However, its spatiotemporal interactions with the genome remain unknown. Single-molecule imaging in cortical neurons revealed that fluorescent-tagged CREB spots frequently reside at fixed nuclear locations in the time range of several seconds. Neuronal activity had little effect on the CREB residence time, but increased the rapid and frequent reappearance of long-residence CREB spots at the same nuclear locations. Thus, activity-dependent transcription is attributable to frequent binding of CREB to specific genome loci.},

Kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of the β-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. The majority of pre-mRNAs are spliced after release, while diffusing away from the site of transcription. A single missense point mutation (S34F) in the essential splicing factor U2AF1 which occurs in human cancers perturbs this kinetic balance and defers splicing to occur entirely post-release.},

Here, we combine lattice light-sheet imaging, single-molecule tracking, numerical simulations, and ChIP-exo mapping to localize and functionally probe Sox2 enhancer-organization in living embryonic stem cells. Sox2 enhancers form 3D-clusters that are segregated from heterochromatin but overlap with a subset of Pol II enriched regions. Sox2 searches for specific binding targets via a 3D-diffusion dominant mode when shuttling long-distances between clusters while chromatin-bound states predominate within individual clusters. Thus, enhancer clustering may reduce global search efficiency but enables rapid local fine-tuning of TF search parameters. Our results suggest an integrated model linking cis-element 3D spatial distribution to local-versus-global target search modalities essential for regulating eukaryotic gene transcription.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors search for specific operator sequences by alternating rounds of 3D diffusion with rounds of 1D diffusion (sliding) along the DNA. The details of such sliding have largely been beyond direct experimental observation. For this purpose we devised an analytical formulation of umbrella sampling along a helical coordinate, and from extensive and fully atomistic simulations we quantified the free-energy landscapes that underlie the sliding dynamics and dissociation kinetics for the LacI dimer. The resulting potential of mean force distributions show a fine structure with an amplitude of 1 k(B)T for sliding and 12 k(B)T for dissociation. Based on the free-energy calculations the repressor slides in close contact with DNA for 8 bp on average before making a microscopic dissociation. By combining the microscopic molecular-dynamics calculations with Brownian simulation including rotational diffusion from the microscopically dissociated state we estimate a macroscopic residence time of 48 ms at the same DNA segment and an in vitro sliding distance of 240 bp. The sliding distance is in agreement with previous in vitro sliding-length estimates. The in vitro prediction for the macroscopic residence time also compares favorably to what we measure by single-molecule imaging of nonspecifically bound fluorescently labeled LacI in living cells. The investigation adds to our understanding of transcription-factor search kinetics and connects the macro-/mesoscopic rate constants to the microscopic dynamics.},

This highlights the necessity to develop single cell-based assays that provide single molecule resolution, and are able to functionally interrogate the role of chromosomal contact on gene regulation.

	abstract = {The binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA controls most aspects of cellular function, making the understanding of their binding kinetics imperative. The standard description of bimolecular interactions posits that TF off rates are independent of TF concentration in solution. However, recent observations have revealed that proteins in solution can accelerate the dissociation of DNA-bound proteins. To study the molecular basis of facilitated dissociation (FD), we have used single-molecule imaging to measure dissociation kinetics of Fis, a keyEscherichia coliTF and major bacterial nucleoid protein, from single dsDNA binding sites. We observe a strong FD effect characterized by an exchange rate [Formula: see text], establishing that FD of Fis occurs at the single-binding site level, and we find that the off rate saturates at large Fis concentrations in solution. Although spontaneous (i.e., competitor-free) dissociation shows a strong salt dependence, we find that FD depends only weakly on salt. These results are quantitatively explained by a model in which partially dissociated bound proteins are susceptible to invasion by competitor proteins in solution. We also report FD of NHP6A, a yeast TF with structure that differs significantly from Fis. We further perform molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that FD can occur for molecules that interact far more weakly than those that we have studied. Taken together, our results indicate that FD is a general mechanism assisting in the local removal of TFs from their binding sites and does not necessarily require cooperativity, clustering, or binding site overlap.},

However, the molecular mechanisms driving epigenetic accessibility are still unknown. We here show that stimulated lymphocytes decondense chromatin by three differentially regulated steps. First, chromatin is repositioned away from the nuclear periphery in response to global acetylation. Second, histone nanodomain clusters decompact into mononucleosome fibers through a mechanism that requires Myc and continual energy input. Single-molecule imaging shows that this step lowers transcription factor residence time and non-specific collisions during sampling for DNA targets. Third, chromatin interactions shift from long range to predominantly short range, and CTCF-mediated loops and contact domains double in numbers. This architectural change facilitates cognate promoter-enhancer contacts and also requires Myc and continual ATP production. Our results thus define the nature and transcriptional impact of chromatin decondensation and reveal an unexpected role for Myc in the establishment of nuclear topology in mammalian cells.},

In this review, we cover recent developments in the prediction of enhancers based on chromatin characteristics and their identification by functional reporter assays and endogenous DNA perturbations. We discuss that the two latter approaches provide different and complementary insights, especially in assessing enhancer sufficiency and necessity for transcription activation. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into mechanistic aspects of enhancer function, including findings about cofactor requirements and the role of post-translational histone modifications such as monomethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me1). Finally, we survey how these approaches advance our understanding of transcription regulation with respect to promoter specificity and transcriptional bursting and provide an outlook covering open questions and promising developments.},

Transcription activation is a key phenomenon in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer and fungal infections.},

We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.},

	abstract = {We present a computational model of transcription factor motion that explains both the observed rapid target finding of transcription factors, and how this motion influences protein and genome structure. Using the Smoldyn software, we modelled transcription factor motion arising from a combination of unrestricted 3D diffusion in the nucleoplasm, sliding along the DNA filament, and transferring directly between filament sections by intersegmental transfer. This presents a fine-grain picture of the way in which transcription factors find their targets two orders of magnitude faster than 3D diffusion alone allows. Eukaryotic genomes contain sections of nucleosome free regions (NFRs) around the promoters; our model shows that the presence and size of these NFRs can be explained as their acting as antennas on which transcription factors slide to reach their targets. Additionally, our model shows that intersegmental transfer may have shaped the quaternary structure of transcription factors: sequence specific DNA binding proteins are unusually enriched in dimers and tetramers, perhaps because these allow intersegmental transfer, which accelerates target site finding. Finally, our model shows that a ‘hopping’ motion can emerge from 3D diffusion on small scales. This explains the apparently long sliding lengths that have been observed for some DNA binding proteins observed in vitro. Together, these results suggest that transcription factor diffusion dynamics help drive the evolution of protein and genome structure.},

Here, we show that quantitating the temporal regulation of key gene states (transcriptionally inactive, active, and refractory) provides a parsimonious framework for analyzing gene regulation. Our theory makes two non-intuitive predictions. First, for transcription factors (TFs) that regulate transcription burst frequency, as opposed to amplitude or duration, weak TF binding is sufficient to elicit strong transcriptional responses. Second, refractoriness of a gene after a transcription burst enables rapid responses to stimuli. We validate both predictions experimentally by exploiting the natural, optogenetic-like responsiveness of the \textit{Neurospora} GATA-type TF White Collar Complex (WCC) to blue light. Further, we demonstrate that differential regulation of WCC target genes is caused by different gene activation rates, not different TF occupancy, and that these rates are tuned by both the core promoter and the distance between TF-binding site and core promoter. In total, our work demonstrates the relevance of a kinetic, non-equilibrium framework for understanding transcriptional regulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Though the interactions between a single nucleosome and RNAP are by now fairly well understood, this understanding has not been synthesized into a description of transcription on crowded genes, where multiple RNAP transcribe through nucleosomes while preserving the nucleosome coverage. We here take a deductive modeling approach to establish the consequences of RNAP–nucleosome interactions for transcription in crowded environments. We show that under physiologically crowded conditions, the interactions of RNAP with nucleosomes induce a strong kinetic attraction between RNAP molecules, causing them to self-organize into stable and moving pelotons. The peloton formation quantitatively explains the observed nucleosome and RNAP depletion close to the initiation site on heavily transcribed genes. Pelotons further translate into short-timescale transcriptional bursts at termination, resulting in burst characteristics consistent with instances of bursty transcription observed in vivo. To facilitate experimental testing of our proposed mechanism, we present several analytic relations that make testable quantitative predictions.},

Much of the chromatin of these embryos was observed in the form of parallel strands which appear to be newly replicated sister chromatids (McKnight and Miller, 1977). Lateral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibers were commonly observed attached to chromatin strands and are believed to be nascent transcripts. Very similar lateral fiber arrays were found on sister chromatid strands. Such paired, post-replicative RNP fiber arrays offer a unique opportunity to compare the transcription patterns on two copies of the same transcription unit. Analyses of paired transcription units yield the following conclusions. Transcription initiation and termination sites are the same for both copies of each transcription unit. Each transcription unit has a characteristic and constant RNP fiber frequency, and the fiber frequency is identical for both copies of the transcription unit. Active transcription units can have internal, fiber-free gaps which may result from interruptions in initiation of transcription. Transcription units differing in polarity and fiber frequency can occur in immediate juxtaposition. The relevance of these findings to eucaryotic transcriptional control mechanisms are discussed.},

Surprisingly, the broad expression of Ato within the ectoderm results in only a modest increase in SOP formation, suggesting many cells are incompetent to become SOPs. Here, we show that the SOP promoting activity of Ato can be greatly enhanced by three factors: the Senseless (Sens) zinc finger protein, the Abdominal-A (Abd-A) Hox factor, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. First, we show that expression of either Ato alone or with Sens induces twice as many SOPs in the abdomen as in the thorax, and do so at the expense of an abdomen-specific cell fate: the larval oenocytes. Second, we demonstrate that Ato stimulates abdominal SOP formation by synergizing with Abd-A to promote EGF ligand (Spitz) secretion and secondary SOP recruitment. However, we also found that Ato and Sens selectively enhance abdominal SOP development in a Spitz-independent manner, suggesting additional genetic interactions between this proneural pathway and Abd-A. Altogether, these experiments reveal that genetic interactions between EGF-signaling, Abd-A, and Sens enhance the SOP-promoting activity of Ato to stimulate region-specific neurogenesis in the Drosophila abdomen.},

	abstract = {Hox transcription factors specify distinct cell types along the anterior-posterior axis of metazoans by regulating target genes that modulate signaling pathways. A well-established example is the induction of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling by an Abdominal-A (Abd-A) Hox complex during the specification of Drosophila hepatocyte-like cells (oenocytes). Previous studies revealed that Abd-A is non-cell autonomously required to promote oenocyte fate by directly activating a gene (rhomboid) that triggers EGF secretion from sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells. Neighboring cells that receive the EGF signal initiate a largely unknown pathway to promote oenocyte fate. Here, we show that Abd-A also plays a cell autonomous role in inducing oenocyte fate by activating the expression of the Pointed-P1 (PntP1) ETS transcription factor downstream of EGF signaling. Genetic studies demonstrate that both PntP1 and PntP2 are required for oenocyte specification. Moreover, we found that PntP1 contains a conserved enhancer (PntP1OE) that is activated in oenocyte precursor cells by EGF signaling via direct regulation by the Pnt transcription factors as well as a transcription factor complex consisting of Abd-A, Extradenticle, and Homothorax. Our findings demonstrate that the same Abd-A Hox complex required for sending the EGF signal from SOP cells, enhances the competency of receiving cells to select oenocyte cell fate by up-regulating PntP1. Since PntP1 is a downstream effector of EGF signaling, these findings provide insight into how a Hox factor can both trigger and potentiate the EGF signal to promote an essential cell fate along the body plan.},

Second, the number of potential Hox binding sites within the genome is vast compared to the number of sites bound. Hence, what determines where in the genome Hox factors bind? Third, what determines whether a Hox factor will activate or repress a specific target gene? Here, we review the current evidence that is beginning to shed light onto these questions.

Starved mutant larvae consume glycogen normally but retain lipids in their midgut and fat body and have increased levels of long-chain fatty acids, suggesting that they are unable to efficiently mobilize stored fat for energy. Microarray studies support this model, indicating reduced expression of genes that control lipid catabolism and beta-oxidation. A GAL4-dHNF4;UAS-lacZ ligand sensor can be activated by starvation or exogenous long-chain fatty acids, suggesting that dHNF4 is responsive to dietary signals.

	doi = {10.1016/j.cub.2011.05.056},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enhancers are genomic cis-regulatory sequences that integrate spatiotemporal signals to control gene expression. Enhancer activity depends on the combination of bound transcription factors as well as-in some cases-the arrangement and spacing of binding sites for these factors. Here, we examine evolutionary changes to the sequence and structure of sparkling, a Notch/EGFR/Runx-regulated enhancer that activates the dPax2 gene in cone cells of the developing Drosophila eye.
RESULTS: Despite functional and structural constraints on its sequence, sparkling has undergone major reorganization in its recent evolutionary history. Our data suggest that the relative strengths of the various regulatory inputs into sparkling change rapidly over evolutionary time, such that reduced input from some factors is compensated by increased input from different regulators. These gains and losses are at least partly responsible for the changes in enhancer structure that we observe. Furthermore, stereotypical spatial relationships between certain binding sites ("grammar elements") can be identified in all sparkling orthologs-although the sites themselves are often recently derived. We also find that low binding affinity for the Notch-regulated transcription factor Su(H), a conserved property of sparkling, is required to prevent ectopic responses to Notch in noncone cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid DNA sequence turnover does not imply either the absence of critical cis-regulatory information or the absence of structural rules. Our findings demonstrate that even a severely constrained cis-regulatory sequence can be significantly rewired over a short evolutionary timescale.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a unique community that spans the biological and physical sciences, making ImageJ an invaluable resource across countless disciplines.

Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ at a critical development crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace.

The new technologies of protein-binding microarrays (PBMs) and high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX) allow measurement of the binding intensities of one transcription factor (TF) to numerous synthetic double-stranded DNA sequences in a single experiment. Recently, Jolma et al. reported the results of 547 HT-SELEX experiments covering human and mouse TFs. Because 162 of these TFs were also covered by PBM technology, for the first time, a large-scale comparison between implementations of these two in vitro technologies is possible. Here we assessed the similarities and differences between binding models, represented as position weight matrices, inferred from PBM and HT-SELEX, and also measured how well these models predict in vivo binding. Our results show that HT-SELEX- and PBM-derived models agree for most TFs. For some TFs, the HT-SELEX-derived models are longer versions of the PBM-derived models, whereas for other TFs, the HT-SELEX models match the secondary PBM-derived models. Remarkably, PBM-based 8-mer ranking is more accurate than that of HT-SELEX, but models derived from HT-SELEX predict in vivo binding better. In addition, we reveal several biases in HT-SELEX data including nucleotide frequency bias, enrichment of C-rich k-mers and oligos and underrepresentation of palindromes.},

In Drosophila, fasting larvae release large quantities of lipid from the fat body but it is unclear how and where this is processed. Here we identify the oenocyte as the principal cell type accumulating lipid droplets during starvation. Tissue-specific manipulations of the Slimfast amino-acid channel, the Lsd2 fat-storage regulator and the Brummer lipase indicate that oenocytes act downstream of the fat body. In turn, oenocytes are required for depleting stored lipid from the fat body during fasting. Hence, lipid-metabolic coupling between the fat body and oenocytes is bidirectional. When food is plentiful, oenocytes have critical roles in regulating growth, development and feeding behaviour. In addition, they specifically express many different lipid-metabolizing proteins, including Cyp4g1, an omega-hydroxylase regulating triacylglycerol composition. These findings provide evidence that some lipid-processing functions of the mammalian liver are performed in insects by oenocytes.},

Here we applied 26 such approaches to in vitro protein binding microarray data for 66 mouse TFs belonging to various families. For nine TFs, we also scored the resulting motif models on in vivo data, and found that the best in vitro-derived motifs performed similarly to motifs derived from the in vivo data. Our results indicate that simple models based on mononucleotide position weight matrices trained by the best methods perform similarly to more complex models for most TFs examined, but fall short in specific cases ({\textless}10\% of the TFs examined here). In addition, the best-performing motifs typically have relatively low information content, consistent with widespread degeneracy in eukaryotic TF sequence preferences.},

	abstract = {Identification of transcription factor binding sites within regulatory segments of genomic DNA is an important step toward understanding of the regulatory circuits that control expression of genes. Here, we describe a novel bioinformatics method that bases classification of potential binding sites explicitly on the estimate of sequence-specific binding energy of a given transcription factor. The method also estimates the chemical potential of the factor that defines the threshold of binding. In contrast with the widely used information-theoretic weight matrix method, the new approach correctly describes saturation in the transcription factor/DNA binding probability. This results in a significant improvement in the number of expected false positives, particularly in the ubiquitous case of low-specificity factors. In the strong binding limit, the algorithm is related to the “support vector machine” approach to pattern recognition. The new method is used to identify likely genomic binding sites for the E. coli transcription factors collected in the DPInteract database. In addition, for CRP (a global regulatory factor), the likely regulatory modality (i.e., repressor or activator) of predicted binding sites is determined.},

	abstract = {Author summary Transcription factors (TFs), a class of DNA-binding proteins, play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. TFs control the rate of transcription by binding to the genome in a sequence-specific manner. Thus, one important aspect in the study of gene regulation mechanism is to model the binding specificities of TFs, namely the features of the DNA sequences that a TF prefers to bind. Multiple models have been proposed to characterize the binding specificities of TFs, among which the class of probabilistic models is the most popular. In this study, we point out several major limitations of the well-established probabilistic model by comparing it with the biophysical model. Through simulations we demonstrate that the probabilistic model is only an approximation of the biophysical model. The latter has most of the advantages of the former, and is a more accurate representation of binding specificities. We propose a shift from the probabilistic model to the biophysical model in future studies of protein-DNA interactions.},

Our knowledge of this process has been mainly derived from protein-centric studies wherein cis-regulatory DNA sequences play a passive role, mainly in arranging the protein machinery to coalesce at the transcription start sites of genes in a spatial and temporal-specific manner. However, this is a highly dynamic process in which molecular motors such as RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), helicases, and other transcription factors, alter the level of mechanical force in DNA, rather than simply a set of static DNA-protein interactions. The double helix is a fiber that responds to flexural and torsional stress, which if accumulated, can affect promoter output as well as change DNA and chromatin structure. The relationship between DNA mechanics and the control of early transcription initiation events has been under-investigated. Genomic techniques to display topological stress and conformational variation in DNA across the mammalian genome provide an exciting new insight on the role of DNA mechanics in the early stages of the transcription cycle. Without understanding how torsional and flexural stresses are generated, transmitted, and dissipated, no model of transcription will be complete and accurate.},

Given their functional relatedness to type 2 helper T cells (T(H)2 cells), we explored whether Gfi1 acts as a shared transcriptional determinant in ILC2 cells. Gfi1 promoted the development of ILC2 cells and controlled their responsiveness during infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and protease allergen-induced lung inflammation. Gfi1 'preferentially' regulated the responsiveness of ILC2 cells to interleukin 33 (IL-33) by directly activating Il1rl1, which encodes the IL-33 receptor (ST2). Loss of Gfi1 in activated ILC2 cells resulted in impaired expression of the transcription factor GATA-3 and a dysregulated genome-wide effector state characterized by coexpression of IL-13 and IL-17. Our findings establish Gfi1 as a shared determinant that reciprocally regulates the type 2 and IL-17 effector states in cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems.},

	doi = {10.1186/1749-8104-6-20},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concept of an equivalence group, a cluster of cells with equal potential to adopt the same specific fate, has served as a useful paradigm to understand neural cell type specification. In the Drosophila eye, a set of five cells, called the 'R7 equivalence group', generates a single photoreceptor neuron and four lens-secreting epithelial cells. This choice between neuronal versus non-neuronal cell fates rests on differential requirements for, and cross-talk between, Notch/Delta- and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling pathways. However, many questions remain unanswered related to how downstream events of these two signaling pathways mediate distinct cell fate decisions.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that two direct downstream targets of Ras and Notch signaling, the transcription factors Prospero and dPax2, are essential regulators of neuronal versus non-neuronal cell fate decisions in the R7 equivalence group. Prospero controls high activated MAPK levels required for neuronal fate, whereas dPax2 represses Delta expression to prevent neuronal fate. Importantly, activity from both factors is required for proper cell fate decisions to occur.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that Ras and Notch signaling are integrated during cell fate decisions within the R7 equivalence group through the combinatorial and opposing activities of Pros and dPax2. Our study provides one of the first examples of how the differential expression and synergistic roles of two independent transcription factors determine cell fate within an equivalence group. Since the integration of Ras and Notch signaling is associated with many developmental and cancer models, these findings should provide new insights into how cell specificity is achieved by ubiquitously used signaling pathways in diverse biological contexts.},

	abstract = {A major question in development is how different specialized cell types arise from a common progenitor. In the adult Drosophila compound eye, color discrimination is achieved by UV-, blue- and green-sensitive photoreceptors (PRs). These different PR subsets arise from neuronal precursors called R7 and R8 cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that R7-based UV-sensitive PRs require the repression of R8-based blue/green-sensitive PR characteristics to properly develop. This repression is mediated by the transcription factor Prospero (Pros). Here, we report that Senseless (Sens), a Drosophila ortholog of the vertebrate Gfi1 transcription factor, plays an opposing role to Pros by both negatively regulating R7-based features and positively enforcing R8-based features during terminal differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate that Pros and Sens function together with the transcription factor Orthodenticle (Otd) to oppositely regulate R7 and R8 PR Rhodopsin gene expression in vitro. These data show that sens, previously shown to be essential for neuronal specification, also controls differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes in the retina. Interestingly, Pros has recently been shown to function as a tumor suppressor, whereas Gfi1 is a well-characterized oncogene. Thus, we propose that sens/pros antagonism is important for regulating many biological processes.},

We previously identified a rho enhancer (RhoBAD) that is active within a subset of abdominal SOP cells to induce larval oenocytes and showed that RhoBAD is regulated by an Abdominal-A (Abd-A) Hox complex and the Senseless (Sens) transcription factor. Here, we show that ato is also required for proper RhoBAD activity and oenocyte formation. Transgenic reporter assays reveal RhoBAD contains two conserved regions that drive SOP gene expression: RhoD mediates low levels of expression in both thoracic and abdominal SOP cells, whereas RhoA drives strong expression within abdominal SOP cells. Ato indirectly stimulates both elements and enhances RhoA reporter activity by interfering with the ability of the Sens repressor to bind DNA. As RhoA is also directly regulated by Abd-A, we propose a model for how the Ato and Sens proneural factors are integrated with an abdominal Hox factor to regulate region-specific SOP gene expression.},

Using recently published universal protein binding microarray (PBM) data on the in vitro DNA binding preferences of these proteins for all possible 8-base-pair sequences, we examined the evolutionary conservation and enrichment within putative regulatory regions of the binding sequences of a diverse library of 104 nonredundant mouse TFs spanning 22 different DNA-binding domain structural classes. We found that not only high affinity binding sites, but also numerous moderate and low affinity binding sites, are under negative selection in the mouse genome. These 8-mers occur preferentially in putative regulatory regions of the mouse genome, including CpG islands and non-exonic ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Of TFs whose PBM "bound" 8-mers are enriched within sets of tissue-specific UCEs, many are expressed in the same tissue(s) as the UCE-driven gene expression. Phylogenetically conserved motif occurrences of various TFs were also enriched in the noncoding sequence surrounding numerous gene sets corresponding to Gene Ontology categories and tissue-specific gene expression clusters, suggesting involvement in transcriptional regulation of those genes. Altogether, our results indicate that many of the sequences bound by these proteins in vitro, including lower affinity DNA sequences, are likely to be functionally important in vivo. This study not only provides an initial analysis of the potential regulatory associations of 104 mouse TFs, but also presents an approach for the functional analysis of TFs from any other metazoan genome as their DNA binding preferences are determined by PBMs or other technologies.},

	abstract = {Elf-1 is an Ets family transcription factor that regulates a number of inducible lymphoid-specific genes, including those encoding interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha chain. A minimal oligonucleotide spanning the IL-2R alpha Elf-1 site (-97/-84) bound Elf-1 poorly, but binding activity markedly increased when this oligonucleotide was multimerized or flanking sequences were added. This result is consistent with the requirement of accessory proteins for efficient Elf-1 binding, as has been demonstrated for the GM-CSF and IL-3 promoters. A binding site selection analysis revealed the optimal Elf-1 consensus motif to be A(A/t)(C/a)CCGGAAGT(A/S), which is similar to the consensus motif for the related Drosophila E74 protein. This minimal high affinity site could bind Elf-1 and functioned as a stronger transcription element than the -97/-84 IL-2R alpha oligonucleotide when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter. In contrast, in the context of the IL-2R alpha promoter, conversion of the naturally occurring low affinity Elf-1 site to an optimal site decreased inducible activation of a reporter construct in Jurkat cells. This finding may be explained by the observation that another Ets family protein, ER GB/Fli-1, can efficiently bind only to the optimal site, and in this context, interferes with Elf-1 binding. Therefore, high affinity Elf-1 sites may lack sufficient binding specificity, whereas naturally occurring low affinity sites presumably favor the association of Elf-1 in the context of accessory proteins. These findings offer an explanation for the lack of optimal sites in any of the known Elf-1-regulated genes.},

To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.},

Both proteins function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes to promoters and enhancers of target genes. The establishment of Gfi1 and Gfi1b reporter mice made it possible to visualize their cell type-specific expression and to understand their function in hematopoietic lineages. We now know that Gfi1 is primarily important in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, whereas Gfi1b is crucial for the generation of red blood cells and platelets. Several rare hematologic diseases are associated with acquired or inheritable mutations in the GFI1 and GFI1B genes. Certain patients with severe congenital neutropenia carry mutations in the GFI1 gene that lead to the disruption of the C-terminal zinc finger domains. Other mutations have been found in the GFI1B gene in families with inherited bleeding disorders. In addition, the Gfi1 locus is frequently found to be a proviral integration site in retrovirus-induced lymphomagenesis, and new, emerging data suggest a role of Gfi1 in human leukemia and lymphoma, underlining the role of both factors not only in normal hematopoiesis, but also in a wide spectrum of human blood diseases.},

We show that the embryonic brain of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster expresses all three sets of homologous genes in a similar tripartite pattern. Thus, a Pax2/5/8 expression domain is located at the interface of brain-specific otd/Otx2 and unpg/Gbx2 expression domains anterior to Hox expression regions. We identify this territory as the deutocerebral/tritocerebral boundary region in the embryonic Drosophila brain. Mutational inactivation of otd/Otx2 and unpg/Gbx2 result in the loss or misplacement of the brain-specific expression domains of Pax2/5/8 and Hox genes. In addition, otd/Otx2 and unpg/Gbx2 appear to negatively regulate each other at the interface of their brain-specific expression domains. Our studies demonstrate that the deutocerebral/tritocerebral boundary region in the embryonic Drosophila brain displays developmental genetic features similar to those observed for the midbrain/hindbrain boundary region in vertebrate brain development. This suggests that a tripartite organization of the embryonic brain was already established in the last common urbilaterian ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes.},

To test this model, we use an assay based on Xenopus animal cap explants in which Spi activation of DER is Rhomboid and Star dependent. We show that Spi is on the cell surface but is kept in an inactive state by its cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains; Rhomboid and Star relieve this inhibition, allowing Spi to signal. We show further that Spi is likely to be cleaved within its transmembrane domain. However, a mutant form of mSpi that is not cleaved still signals to DER in a Rhomboid and Star-dependent manner.

Here we show that Spalt works as a cell fate switch between two EGFR-induced cell types, the oenocytes and the precursors of the pentascolopodial organ in the embryonic peripheral nervous system. We show that removal of spalt increases the number of scolopodia, as a result of extra secondary recruitment of precursor cells at the expense of the oenocytes. In addition, the absence of spalt causes defects in the normal migration of the pentascolopodial organ. The dual function of spalt in the development of this organ, recruitment of precursors and migration, is reminiscent of its role in tracheal formation and of the role of a spalt homologue, sem-4, in the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system.},

	abstract = {Signaling from the EGF receptor (EGFR) can trigger the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types in many animal species. We have explored the mechanisms that generate this diversity using the Drosophila peripheral nervous system. In this context, Spitz (SPI) ligand can induce two alternative cell fates from the dorsolateral ectoderm: chordotonal sensory organs and non-neural oenocytes. We show that the overall number of both cell types that are induced is controlled by the degree of EGFR signaling. In addition, the spalt (sal) gene is identified as a critical component of the oenocyte/chordotonal fate switch. Genetic and expression analyses indicate that the SAL zinc-finger protein promotes oenocyte formation and supresses chordotonal organ induction by acting both downstream and in parallel to the EGFR. To explain these findings, we propose a prime-and-respond model. Here, sal functions prior to signaling as a necessary but not sufficient component of the oenocyte prepattern that also serves to raise the apparent threshold for induction by SPI. Subsequently, sal-dependent SAL upregulation is triggered as part of the oenocyte-specific EGFR response. Thus, a combination of SAL in the responding nucleus and increased SPI ligand production sets the binary cell-fate switch in favour of oenocytes. Together, these studies help to explain how one generic signaling pathway can trigger the differentiation of two distinct cell types.},

The introduced profiles represent an 83\% expansion and 10\% update when compared to the previous release. We updated the structural annotation of the TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) following a published hierarchical structural classification. In addition, we introduced 130 transcription factor flexible models trained on ChIP-seq data for vertebrates, which capture dinucleotide dependencies within TF binding sites. This new JASPAR release is accompanied by a new web tool to infer JASPAR TF binding profiles recognized by a given TF protein sequence. Moreover, we provide the users with a Ruby module complementing the JASPAR API to ease programmatic access and use of the JASPAR collection of profiles.

We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities ("suboptimization"). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain "superenhancers," circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are short segments of DNA that switch genes on and off in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Despite the discovery of the first enhancer more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the importance of "syntax" (the order, orientation, and spacing of binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a "regulatory code" of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra), a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly underappreciated feature of the regulatory genome.},

	abstract = {The Drosophila PBC protein Extradenticle (Exd) is regulated at the level of its subcellular distribution: It is cytoplasmic in the absence of Homothorax (Hth), a Meis family member, and nuclear in the presence of Hth. Here we present evidence that, in the absence of Hth, Exd is exported from nuclei due to the activity of a nuclear export signal (NES). The activity of this NES is inhibited by the antibiotic Leptomycin B, suggesting that Exd is exported by a CRM1/exportin1-related export pathway. By analyzing the subcellular localization of Exd deletion mutants in imaginal discs and cultured cells, we identified three elements in Exd, a putative NES, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a region required for Hth-mediated nuclear localization. This latter region coincides with a domain in Exd that binds Hth protein in vitro. When Exd is uncomplexed with Hth, the NES dominates over the NLS. When Exd is expressed together with Hth, or when the NES is deleted, Exd is nuclear. Thus, Hth is required to overcome the influence of the NES, possibly by inducing a conformational change in Exd. Finally, we provide evidence that Hth and Exd normally interact in the cytoplasm, and that Hth also has an NLS. We propose that in Exd there exists a balance between the activities of an NES and an NLS, and that Hth alters this balance in favor of the NLS.},

	abstract = {Light-regulation of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes is mediated by multipartite cis-regulatory units located in their promoter regions. The combination, spacing, and relative orientation of transcription factor binding sites in these units influences the assembly of specific multiprotein complexes that control gene expression. In this work, the functional architecture of the conserved modular array 5 (CMA5), a previously characterized minimal light-regulatory unit of rbcS gene promoters, has been analysed. With the aim of defining the sequences of CMA5 that, besides the I- and G-box elements, are essential for CMA5 responsiveness to light and chloroplast-derived signals, a series of mutations affecting the sequences flanking these elements was performed. It was found that an I-box associated module, named IbAM5, is essential for CMA5 functionality and is able to bind nuclear proteins in vitro. The spacing requirements of the I- and G-box elements in achieving adequate combinatorial interaction were also studied as well as the effect of interchanging the relative position of these elements in the native rbcS promoter arrangement. The results show that helical phasing and distance between the I- and G-box motifs are critical to determine the functionality and transcriptional strength of CMA5. Furthermore, it is shown that the relative position of the IbAM5/I-box composite element and the G-box element is not critical for the enhancer activity of CMA5, as long as the proper distance between them is maintained. Taken together, these results suggest that the light-responsive, plastid-dependent activity of CMA5 requires the synergistic interaction of several DNA-binding transcription factors assembled in a higher-order nucleoprotein complex.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spatial organization of transcription factor binding sites in regulatory DNA, and the composition of intersite sequences, influences the assembly of the multiprotein complexes that regulate RNA polymerase recruitment and thereby affects transcription. We have developed a genetic approach to investigate how reporter gene transcription is affected by varying the spacing between transcription factor binding sites. We characterized the components of promoter architecture that govern the yeast transcription factors Cbf1 and Met31/32, which bind independently, but collaboratively recruit the coactivator Met4.
RESULTS: A Cbf1 binding site was required upstream of a Met31/32 binding site for full reporter gene expression. Distance constraints on coactivator recruitment were more flexible than those for cooperatively binding transcription factors. Distances from 18 to 50 bp between binding sites support efficient recruitment of Met4, with only slight modulation by helical phasing. Intriguingly, we found that certain sequences located between the binding sites abolished gene expression.
CONCLUSION: These results yield insight to the influence of both binding site architecture and local DNA flexibility on gene expression, and can be used to refine computational predictions of gene expression from promoter sequences. In addition, our approach can be applied to survey promoter architecture requirements for arbitrary combinations of transcription factor binding sites.},

However, there are examples of fixed arrangements of binding sites, such as helical phasing, that promote the formation of higher-order protein complexes on the enhancer DNA template. Here, we investigate the regulatory 'grammar' of nearly 100 characterized enhancers for developmental control genes active in the early Drosophila embryo. The conservation of grammar is examined in seven divergent Drosophila genomes. Linked binding sites are observed for particular combinations of binding motifs, including Bicoid-Bicoid, Hunchback-Hunchback, Bicoid-Dorsal, Bicoid-Caudal and Dorsal-Twist. Direct evidence is presented for the importance of Bicoid-Dorsal linkage in the integration of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterning systems. Hunchback-Hunchback interactions help explain unresolved aspects of segmentation, including the differential regulation of the eve stripe 3 + 7 and stripe 4 + 6 enhancers. We also present evidence that there is an under-representation of nucleosome positioning sequences in many enhancers, raising the possibility for a subtle higher-order structure extending across certain enhancers. We conclude that grammar of gene control regions is pervasively used in the patterning of the Drosophila embryo.},

Repressors such as Knirps, Krüppel, and Snail mediate short-range repression and interact with the dCtBP corepressor. The mechanism by which short-range repressors block transcription is not well understood; therefore, we have undertaken a detailed structure-function analysis of the Knirps protein. To provide a physiological setting for measurement of repression, the activities of endogenous or chimeric Knirps repressor proteins were assayed on integrated reporter genes in transgenic embryos. Two distinct repression functions were identified in Knirps. One repression activity depends on dCtBP binding, and this function maps to a C-terminal region of Knirps that contains a dCtBP binding motif. In addition, an N-terminal region was identified that represses in a CtBP mutant background and does not bind to the dCtBP protein in vitro. Although the dCtBP protein is important for Knirps activity on some genes, one endogenous target of the Knirps protein, the even-skipped stripe 3 enhancer, is not derepressed in a CtBP mutant. These results indicate that Knirps can utilize two different pathways to mediate transcriptional repression and suggest that the phenomenon of short-range repression may be a combination of independent activities.},

Analysis of non-overlapping binding motifs revealed the presence of periodic signals specific to particular combinations of binding motifs. The most striking periodic signals (10 bp for Bicoid and 11 bp for Hunchback) suggest preferential positioning of some binding site combinations on the same side of the DNA helix. We also analyzed distance preferences in arrangements of highly correlated overlapping binding motifs, such as Bicoid and Krüppel. Based on the distance analysis, we extracted preferential binding site arrangements and proposed models for potential composite elements (CEs) and antagonistic motif pairs involved in the function of developmental CRMs. Our results suggest that there are distinct hierarchical levels in the organization of transcription regulatory information. We discuss the role of the hierarchy in understanding transcriptional regulation and in detection of transcription regulatory regions in genomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transport and catabolism of sialic acid, a critical virulence factor for nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, is regulated by two transcription factors, SiaR and CRP.
RESULTS: Using a mutagenesis approach, glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) was identified as a co-activator for SiaR. Evidence for the cooperative regulation of both the sialic acid catabolic and transport operons suggested that cooperativity between SiaR and CRP is required for regulation. cAMP was unable to influence the expression of the catabolic operon in the absence of SiaR but was able to induce catabolic operon expression when both SiaR and GlcN-6P were present. Alteration of helical phasing supported this observation by uncoupling SiaR and CRP regulation. The insertion of one half-turn of DNA between the SiaR and CRP operators resulted in the loss of SiaR-mediated repression of the transport operon while eliminating cAMP-dependent induction of the catabolic operon when GlcN-6P was present. SiaR and CRP were found to bind to their respective operators simultaneously and GlcN-6P altered the interaction of SiaR with its operator.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest multiple novel features for the regulation of these two adjacent operons. SiaR functions as both a repressor and an activator and SiaR and CRP interact to regulate both operons from a single set of operators.},

Here, we present evidence that the sog shadow enhancer employs dual modes of transcriptional synergy to produce this broad pattern. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that a minimal enhancer region, systematically mapped in vivo, contains five Dl-, three Zelda (Zld)-, and three Bicoid (Bcd)-binding sites; four of these five Dl-binding sites are closed linked to two Zld- and two Bcd-binding sites. Mutations of either the linked Zld- or Bcd-binding sites led to severe reduction in lacZ expression width, length, and/or strength in transgenic embryos. In addition, alteration of the helical phasing in this enhancer region by insertion of spacer sequences between linked sites also resulted in aberrant lacZ expression. These results suggest that synergistic interactions between Dl and Zld and between DI and Bcd are required for broad sog expression.},

Members of the hox gene family share a conserved DNA binding domain, termed the homeodomain, which mediates interactions of Hox proteins with DNA regulatory elements in the transcriptional control regions of target genes. In this study, we characterized the DNA binding properties of five representative members of the Hox family: HoxA5, HoxB4, HoxA7, HoxC8, and HoxB1. To facilitate a comparative analysis of their DNA binding properties, we produced the homeodomain regions of these Hox proteins in Escherichia coli and obtained highly purified polypeptides. We showed that these Hox proteins interact in vitro with a common consensus DNA site that contains the motif (C/G)TAATTG. We further showed that the Hox proteins recognize the consensus DNA site in vivo, as determined by their ability to activate transcription through this site in transient transfection assays. Although they interact optimally with the consensus DNA site, the Hox proteins exhibit subtle, but distinct, preferences for DNA sites that contain variations of the nucleotides within the consensus motif. In addition to their modest differences in DNA binding specificities, the Hox proteins also vary in their relative affinities for DNA. Intriguingly, their relative affinities correlate with the positions of their respective genes on the hox cluster. These findings suggest that subtle differences in DNA binding specificity combined with differences in DNA binding affinity constitute features of the "Hox code" that contribute to the selective functions of Hox proteins during murine embryogenesis.},

The en binding sites contain at least one copy of a 10-base pair consensus sequence: T-C-A-A-T-T-A-A-A-T. In contrast, the 5' eve binding sites are relatively G-C rich and do not share obvious similarities with the 10-base pair consensus sequence associated with en. Other homeo box proteins can recognize both classes of eve binding sites, lending support to the proposal that regulatory interactions among homeo box genes involve a competition of different homeo box proteins for similar cis regulatory sequences.},

	abstract = {Murine homeobox genes play a fundamental role in directing embryogenesis by controlling gene expression during development. The homeobox encodes a DNA binding domain (the homeodomain) which presumably mediates interactions of homeodomain proteins with specific DNA sites in the control regions of target genes. However, the bases for these selective DNA-protein interactions are not well defined. In this report, we have characterized the DNA binding specificities of three murine homeodomain proteins, Hox 7.1, Hox 1.5, and En-1. We have identified optimal DNA binding sites for each of these proteins by using a random oligonucleotide selection strategy. Comparison of the sequences of the selected binding sites predicted a common consensus site that contained the motif (C/G)TAATTG. The TAAT core was essential for DNA binding activity, and the nucleotides flanking this core directed binding specificity. Whereas variations in the nucleotides flanking the 5' side of the TAAT core produced modest alterations in binding activity for all three proteins, perturbations of the nucleotides directly 3' of the core distinguished the binding specificity of Hox 1.5 from those of Hox 7.1 and En-1. These differences in binding activity reflected differences in the dissociation rates rather than the equilibrium constants of the protein-DNA complexes. Differences in DNA binding specificities observed in vitro may contribute to selective interactions of homeodomain proteins with potential binding sites in the control regions of target genes.},

Here, we focus on one mechanism, collaborative competition, which is of interest because it arises both automatically (with no requirement for TF coevolution) and spontaneously (with no requirement for ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors). Previous experimental studies of collaborative competition analyzed cases in which target sites for pairs of cooperating TFs were contained within the same side of the nucleosome. Here, we utilize new assays to measure cooperativity in protein binding to pairs of nucleosomal DNA target sites. We focus on the cases that are of greatest in vivo relevance, in which one binding site is located close to the end of a nucleosome and the other binding site is located at diverse positions throughout the nucleosome. Our results reveal energetically significant positive (favorable) cooperativity for pairs of sites on the same side of the nucleosome but, for the cases examined, energetically insignificant cooperativity between sites on opposite sides of the nucleosome. These findings imply a special significance for TF binding sites that are spaced within one-half nucleosome length (74 bp) or less along the genome and may prove useful for prediction of cooperatively acting TFs genome wide.},

In vitro, binding is inherently cooperative between arbitrary DNA binding proteins whose target sites are located within the same nucleosome. We refer to such competition-based cooperativity as collaborative competition. Here we show that arbitrarily chosen foreign DNA binding proteins, LexA and Tet repressor, cooperate with an adjacently binding endogenous activator protein, Gcn4, to coactivate expression of chromosomal reporter genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Coactivation requires that the cooperating target sites be within a nucleosome-length distance; it leads to increased occupancy by Gcn4 at its binding site; and it requires both Gcn5 and Swi/Snf which, at an endogenous Gcn4-dependent promoter, act subsequent to Gcn4 binding. These results imply that collaborative competition contributes to gene regulation in vivo. They further imply that, even in the presence of the cell's full wild-type complement of chromatin remodeling factors, competition of regulatory proteins with histone octamer for access to regulatory target sites remains a quantitative determinant of gene expression levels. We speculate that initial target site recognition and binding may occur via spontaneous nucleosomal site exposure, with remodeling factor action required downstream to lock in higher levels of regulatory protein occupancy.},

In contrast, reporter gene studies have identified {\textgreater}60 Bcd-dependent enhancers, all of which contain clusters of the consensus binding sequence TAATCC. These studies also identified clusters of TAATCC motifs (inactive fragments) that failed to drive Bcd-dependent activation. In general, active fragments showed higher levels of Bcd binding in vivo and were enriched in predicted binding sites for the ubiquitous maternal protein Zelda (Zld). Here we tested the role of Zld in Bcd-mediated binding and transcription. Removal of Zld function and mutations in Zld sites caused significant reductions in Bcd binding to known enhancers and variable effects on the activation and spatial positioning of Bcd-dependent expression patterns. Also, insertion of Zld sites converted one of six inactive fragments into a Bcd-responsive enhancer. Genome-wide binding experiments in zld mutants showed variable effects on Bcd-binding peaks, ranging from strong reductions to significantly enhanced levels of binding. Increases in Bcd binding caused the precocious Bcd-dependent activation of genes that are normally not expressed in early embryos, suggesting that Zld controls the genome-wide binding profile of Bcd at the qualitative level and is critical for selecting target genes for activation in the early embryo. These results underscore the importance of combinatorial binding in enhancer function and provide data that will help predict regulatory activities based on DNA sequence.},

Combining DNaseI accessibility and chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing, we identify the activator protein 1 (AP1) as a major partner for productive GR-chromatin interactions. AP1 is critical for GR-regulated transcription and recruitment to co-occupied regulatory elements, illustrating an extensive AP1-GR interaction network. Importantly, the maintenance of baseline chromatin accessibility facilitates GR recruitment and is dependent on AP1 binding.

	abstract = {The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin complex regulates gene transcription via high-order chromatin organization of the genome. De novo methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region is an epigenetic hallmark of gene silencing in cancer. Although the CTCF/cohesin complex preferentially targets hypomethylated DNA, it remains unclear whether the CTCF/cohesin-mediated high-order chromatin structure is affected by DNA methylation during tumorigenesis. We found that DNA methylation downregulates the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is an inducible, rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis, by disrupting CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping. We show that the CTCF/cohesin complex is enriched near a CpG island associated with PTGS2 and that the PTGS2 locus forms chromatin loops through methylation-sensitive binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex. DNA methylation abolishes the association of the CTCF/cohesin complex with the PTGS2 CpG island. Disruption of chromatin looping by DNA methylation abrogates the enrichment of transcriptional components, such as positive elongation factor b, at the transcriptional start site of the PTGS2 locus. These alterations result in the downregulation of PTGS2. Our results provide evidence that CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping of the PTGS2 locus is dynamically influenced by the DNA methylation status.},

	abstract = {Summary
Mammalian genomes are organized into megabase-scale topologically associated domains (TADs). We demonstrate that disruption of TADs can rewire long-range regulatory architecture and result in pathogenic phenotypes. We show that distinct human limb malformations are caused by deletions, inversions, or duplications altering the structure of the TAD-spanning WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 locus. Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome.},

Surprisingly, CRMs that control essential gene patterns can differ greatly in conservation, suggesting distinct constraints on TF binding sites. Here, we show that a highly conserved Distal-less regulatory element (DCRE) that controls gene expression in leg precursor cells recruits multiple Hox, Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth) complexes to mediate dual outputs: thoracic activation and abdominal repression. Using reporter assays, we found that abdominal repression is particularly robust, as neither individual binding site mutations nor a DNA binding deficient Hth protein abolished cooperative DNA binding and in vivo repression. Moreover, a re-engineered DCRE containing a distinct configuration of Hox, Exd, and Hth sites also mediated abdominal Hox repression. However, the re-engineered DCRE failed to perform additional segment-specific functions such as thoracic activation. These findings are consistent with two emerging concepts in gene regulation: First, the abdominal Hox/Exd/Hth factors utilize protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to form repression complexes on flexible combinations of sites, consistent with the TF collective model of CRM organization. Second, the conserved DCRE mediates multiple cell-type specific outputs, consistent with recent findings that pleiotropic CRMs are associated with conserved TF binding and added evolutionary constraints.},

While expression analysis has uncovered large numbers of de-regulated genes in cells with altered Hox activity, determining which are direct versus indirect targets has remained a significant challenge. Here, we characterize the DNA binding activity of Hox transcription factor complexes on eight experimentally verified cis-regulatory elements. Hox factors regulate the activity of each element by forming protein complexes with two cofactor proteins, Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth). Using comparative DNA binding assays, we found that a number of flexible arrangements of Hox, Exd, and Hth binding sites mediate cooperative transcription factor complexes. Moreover, analysis of a Distal-less regulatory element (DMXR) that is repressed by abdominal Hox factors revealed that suboptimal binding sites can be combined to form high affinity transcription complexes. Lastly, we determined that the anterior Hox factors are more dependent upon Exd and Hth for complex formation than posterior Hox factors. Based upon these findings, we suggest a general set of guidelines to serve as a basis for designing bioinformatics algorithms aimed at identifying Hox regulatory elements using the wealth of recently sequenced genomes.},

As predicted, heat induction at defined larval stages leads to the transformation of antennae into second legs. The dorsal part of the head can also be transformed into second thoracic structures (scutum) indicating that Antp indeed specifies the second thoracic segment.

Here, we investigate the role of binding site affinity in the transcriptional interpretation of Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen gradients. We noted that enhancers of several Hh-responsive Drosophila genes have low predicted affinity for Ci, the Gli family TF that transduces Hh signalling in the fly. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, improving the affinity of Ci/Gli sites in enhancers of dpp, wingless and stripe, by transplanting optimal sites from the patched gene, did not result in ectopic responses to Hh signalling. Instead, we found that these enhancers require low-affinity binding sites for normal activation in regions of relatively low signalling. When Ci/Gli sites in these enhancers were altered to improve their binding affinity, we observed patterning defects in the transcriptional response that are consistent with a switch from Ci-mediated activation to Ci-mediated repression. Synthetic transgenic reporters containing isolated Ci/Gli sites confirmed this finding in imaginal discs. We propose that the requirement for gene activation by Ci in the regions of low-to-moderate Hh signalling results in evolutionary pressure favouring weak binding sites in enhancers of certain Hh target genes.},

We identified a rhomboid enhancer that is active in these cells and show that an abdominal Hox complex directly competes with Senseless for enhancer binding, with the transcriptional outcome dependent upon their relative binding activities. Thus, Hox-Senseless antagonism forms a molecular switch that integrates neural and anterior-posterior positional information.

Here, we use scanning mutagenesis coupled with reporter assays, biochemistry and genetics to dissect the transcriptional mechanisms regulating SOP-specific rhomboid activation. Our results show that proper spatial activity of the rhomboid CRM is dependent upon direct integration of the abdomen-specific Hox factor Abdominal-A and the SOP-restricted Pax2 factor. In addition, we show that the Extradenticle and Homothorax Hox co-factors are differentially integrated on the rhomboid CRM by abdominal versus thoracic Hox proteins in the presence of Pax2. Last, we show that Abdominal-A uses both Pax2-dependent and Pax2-independent mechanisms to stimulate rhomboid CRM activity to induce proper oenocyte numbers.

	abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs), proteins that recognize short DNA sequence motifs. Such sequences are very common in the human genome, and an important determinant of the specificity of gene expression is the cooperative binding of multiple TFs to closely located motifs. However, interactions between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized. To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF-TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs. Together, our results indicate that the DNA molecule commonly plays an active role in cooperative interactions that define the gene regulatory lexicon.},

The Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) suppresses limb formation in the abdomen by repressing the leg selector gene Distalless, whereas Antennapedia (Antp), a thoracic Hox protein, does not repress Distalless. We show that the Hox cofactors Extradenticle and Homothorax selectively enhance Ubx, but not Antp, binding to a Distalless regulatory sequence. A C-terminal peptide in Ubx stimulates binding to this site. However, DNA binding is not sufficient for Distalless repression. Instead, an additional alternatively spliced domain in Ubx is required for Distalless repression but not DNA binding. Thus, the functional specificities of Hox proteins depend on both DNA binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Hox genes in species across the metazoa encode transcription factors (TFs) containing highly-conserved homeodomains that bind target DNA sequences to regulate batteries of developmental target genes. DNA-bound Hox proteins, together with other TF partners, induce an appropriate transcriptional response by RNA Polymerase II (PolII) and its associated general transcription factors. How the evolutionarily conserved Hox TFs interface with this general machinery to generate finely regulated transcriptional responses remains obscure. One major component of the PolII machinery, the Mediator (MED) transcription complex, is composed of roughly 30 protein subunits organized in modules that bridge the PolII enzyme to DNA-bound TFs. Here, we investigate the physical and functional interplay between Drosophila melanogaster Hox developmental TFs and MED complex proteins. We find that the Med19 subunit directly binds Hox homeodomains, in vitro and in vivo. Loss-of-function Med19 mutations act as dose-sensitive genetic modifiers that synergistically modulate Hox-directed developmental outcomes. Using clonal analysis, we identify a role for Med19 in Hox-dependent target gene activation. We identify a conserved, animal-specific motif that is required for Med19 homeodomain binding, and for activation of a specific Ultrabithorax target. These results provide the first direct molecular link between Hox homeodomain proteins and the general PolII machinery. They support a role for Med19 as a PolII holoenzyme-embedded "co-factor" that acts together with Hox proteins through their homeodomains in regulated developmental transcription.},

	abstract = {We characterized a gene, extradenticle, which seems to interact with a specific subset of Drosophila homeo domain proteins, possibly affecting their target specificity. This interpretation is based on an examination of the zygotic and maternal effect phenotypes of extradenticle mutations. In embryos with reduced levels of extradenticle gene product, anterior and posterior segmental transformations occur. Segmental identity in Drosophila is mediated by the products of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes. These homeo domain proteins  are thought to regulate different target genes specifically in each segment, resulting in different morphologies. extradenticle alters segmental identity without affecting the pattern of expression of homeotic genes. Genetic tests demonstrate that in extradenticle mutants, the homeotic proteins are functional and act in their normal segmental domains, yet segmental identities are altered.  Even when homeotic proteins are ectopically expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter, extradenticle mutations affect their consequences. Thus, in the absence of sufficient extradenticle product, altered segmental morphology  results from alteration of the functional consequences of specific homeo domain proteins, possibly through alterations in their target gene specificity. extradenticle is also expressed maternally. Complete removal of extradenticle, maternally and zygotically, leads to specific alterations in segmentation, many of which result from failure to maintain the expression of the homeo domain protein engrailed.},

In Artemia the three 'trunk' genes Antp, Ubx and abdA are expressed in largely overlapping domains in the uniform thoracic region, whereas in insects they specify distinct segment types within the thorax and abdomen. Our comparisons suggest a multistep process for the diversification of these Hox gene functions,  involving early differences in tissue specificity and the later acquisition of a  role in defining segmental differences within the trunk. We propose that the branchiopod thorax may be homologous to the entire pregenital (thoracic and abdominal) region of the insect trunk.},

We demonstrate that wild-type Pbx proteins and chimeric E2a-Pbx1 oncoproteins cooperatively bind a consensus DNA probe with  HoxB4, B6, and B7 of the Antennapedia class of Hox/HOM proteins. Specificity of Hox-Pbx interactions was suggested by the inability of Pbx proteins to cooperatively bind the synthetic DNA target with HoxA10 or Drosophila even-skipped. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the hexapeptide motif (IYPWMK) upstream of the Hox homeo domain was essential for HoxB6 and B7 to cooperatively bind DNA with Pbx proteins. Engraftment of the HoxB7 hexapeptide onto HoxA10 endowed it with robust cooperative properties, demonstrating a functional role for the highly conserved hexapeptide element as one of the molecular determinants delimiting Hox-Pbx cooperativity. The Pbx homeo domain was necessary but not sufficient for cooperativity, which required conserved amino acids carboxy-terminal of the homeo domain. These findings demonstrate that interactions between Hox and Pbx proteins modulate their DNA-binding properties,  suggesting that Pbx and Hox proteins act in parallel as heterotypic complexes to  regulate expression of specific subordinate genes.},

Other factors are also required, including one that appears to act through homeodomain protein binding sites and may be encoded by extradenticle (exd). The exd protein binds in a highly co-operative manner to regulatory sequences mediating PS7-specific dpp expression, consistent with a genetic requirement for exd function in normal visceral mesoderm expression of dpp. A second mechanism contributing to PS7 expression of dpp appears not to require Ubx protein directly, and involves a general visceral mesoderm enhancer coupled to a  spatially specific repression element. Thus, even in an apparently simple case where visceral mesoderm expression of the dpp target gene mirrors that of the Ubx HOM protein, full activation by Ubx protein requires at least one additional factor. In addition, a distinct regulatory mode not directly involving Ubx protein also appears to contribute to PS7-specific expression.},

Here we show that exd is indeed required for the appropriate  regulation of at least some of these target genes. Expression patterns of wingless, teashirt and decapentaplegic (dpp) are altered in the embryonic midgut  of embryos lacking exd, while the expression of their respective regulators (abd-A, Antp and Ubx) remains normal. Co-regulation of dpp by exd and Ubx was investigated in greater detail by examining the expression of reporter constructs in exd embryos. These experiments not only define dpp regulatory regions responsive to exd, but also distinguish two functions of exd in the regulation of dpp. exd acts with Ubx to activate dpp expression in parasegment 7 (PS7), via a minimal visceral mesoderm enhancer, and exd represses dpp expression anterior to  PS7. We show that even when Ubx is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in exd embryos, Ubx is incapable of activating dpp enhancer expression.

Unlike the UBX proteins expressed in E. coli, UBX isoforms expressed in D. melanogaster cells are phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, located primarily within a 53 aa region near the middle of the N-constant region, to form at least five phosphorylated states per isoform. Similar, if not identical states can be generated in vitro from purified E. coli UBX protein by a kinase activity in nuclear extracts from D. melanogaster cells. Temporal developmental profiles of UBX isoforms parallel those for the respective mRNAs, and all isoforms are similarly phosphorylated throughout embryogenesis. Analysis by cotransfection assays of the promoter activation and repression functions of mutant UBX proteins with various deletions in the N-constant region shows that repression is generally insensitive to deletion and, hence, presumably to phosphorylation. By contrast, the activation function is differentially sensitive to the different deletions in a manner indicating the absence of a discrete activating domain and  instead, the presence of multiple activating sequences spread throughout the region.},

Genetic analysis has shown that Distal-less functions as a developmental switch that is required to promote the development of limb structures above the evolutionary ground-state of body wall.  Here we provide genetic evidence that indicates a graded requirement for Distal-less activity during limb development. Reduction of this activity has a global effect on pattern formation in the limb.

We report the isolation of a new locus, Meis1, that serves as a site of viral integration in 15\% of the tumors arising in BXH-2 mice. Meis1 was mapped to a distinct location  on proximal mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that it represents a novel locus. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids segregating human chromosomes allowed localization of MEIS1 to human chromosome 2p23-p12, in a region known to contain  translocations found in human leukemias. Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated that a Meis1 probe detected a 3.8-kb mRNA present in all BXH-2 tumors, whereas tumors containing integrations at the Meis1 locus expressed an additional truncated transcript. A Meis1 cDNA clone that encoded a novel member of the homeobox gene family was identified. The homeodomain of Meis1 is most closely related to those of the PBX/exd family of homeobox protein-encoding genes, suggesting that Meis1 functions in a similar fashion by cooperative binding to a distinct subset of HOX proteins.

The homeoprotein encoded by the extradenticle (exd) gene can selectively modify HOX DNA binding, suggesting that  it contributes to HOX specificity in vivo. HOX-EXD interactions are in part mediated by a conserved stretch of amino acids termed the hexapeptide found in many HOX proteins. Here, we demonstrate that a 20 bp oligonucleotide from the 5'  region of the mouse Hoxb-1 gene, a homolog of Drosophila labial (lab), is sufficient to direct an expression pattern in Drosophila that is very similar to  endogenous lab. In vivo, this expression requires lab and exd and, in vitro, LAB  requires EXD to bind this oligonucleotide. In contrast, LAB proteins with mutations in the hexapeptide bind DNA even in the absence of EXD. Moreover, a hexapeptide mutant of LAB has an increased ability to activate transcription in vivo. Partial proteolysis experiments suggest that EXD can induce a conformational change in LAB. These data are consistent with a mechanism whereby  the LAB hexapeptide inhibits LAB function by inhibiting DNA binding and that an},

The functional role of these interactions was studied using  the transcriptional activity of the human HOXD9 protein as a model. HMG1 enhances, in a dose-dependent fashion, the sequence-specific DNA binding activity in vitro, and the transcriptional activation in a co-transfection assay in vivo,  of the HOXD9 protein. Functional interaction between HMG1 and HOXD9 is dependent  on the DNA binding activity of the homeodomain, and requires the HOXD9 transcriptional activation domain. HMG1 enhances activation by HOXD9, but not by  HOXD8, of the HOXD9-controlled element. Specific target recognition and functional interaction with HMG1 can be transferred to HOXD8 by homeodomain swapping. We propose that HMG1-like proteins might be general co-factors in},

However, the AbdB-like Hox proteins from paralogs 11, 12, and 13 do not interact with Pbx1a, raising the possibility of different protein partners. The Meis1 homeobox gene has 44\% identity to Pbx within the homeodomain and was identified as a common site of viral integration in myeloid leukemias arising in BXH-2 mice. These integrations result in constitutive activation of Meis1. Furthermore, the Hoxa-9 gene is frequently activated by viral integration in the same BXH-2 leukemias, suggesting a biological synergy between these two distinct classes of homeodomain proteins in  causing malignant transformation. We now show that the Hoxa-9 protein physically  interacts with Meis1 proteins by forming heterodimeric binding complexes on a DNA target containing a Meis1 site (TGACAG) and an AbdB-like Hox site (TTTTACGAC). Hox proteins from the other AbdB-like paralogs, Hoxa-10, Hoxa-11, Hoxd-12, and Hoxb-13, also form DNA binding complexes with Meis1b, while Hox proteins from other paralogs do not appear to interact with Meis1 proteins.

The Prep1-Pbx protein-protein interaction is essential for DNA-binding activity. Prep1-Pbx complexes are present in early mouse embryos at a time when Pbx is also interacting with Hox proteins. The use of different interaction surfaces could allow Pbx to interact with Prep1 and Hox proteins simultaneously.

The most significant results can be summarized as follows. (i) Most of PBX N terminal to the homeodomain is required for efficient cooperative binding with HOXD4 and HOXD9. (ii) MEIS and PBX proteins form higher-order complexes on a heterodimeric binding site. (iii) Although MEIS does not cooperatively bind DNA with ANTP class HOX proteins, it does form a trimer as a non-DNA-binding partner  with DNA-bound PBX-HOXD4. (iv) The N terminus of HOXD4 negatively regulates trimer formation. (v) MEIS forms a similar trimer with DNA-bound PBX-HOXD9. (vi)  A related trimer (where MEIS is a non-DNA-binding partner) is formed on a transcriptional promoter within the cell. (vii) We observe an additional trimer class involving non-DNA-bound PBX and DNA-bound MEIS-HOXD9 or MEIS-HOXD10 heterodimers that is enhanced by mutation of the PBX homeodomain. (viii) In this  latter trimer, PBX is likely to contact both MEIS and HOXD9/D10. (ix) The stability of DNA binding by all trimers is enhanced relative to the heterodimers.

The strategy is based on a flexible set-based description of amino acid properties, which is used to define the conservation between any group of amino acids. Sequences in the alignment are gathered into subgroups on the basis  of sequence similarity, functional, evolutionary or other criteria. All pairs of  subgroups are then compared to highlight positions that confer the unique features of each subgroup.

The algorithm is illustrated by application to an alignment of 67 SH2  domains where patterns of conserved hydrophobic residues that constitute the protein core are highlighted. The analysis of charge conservation across annexin  domains identifies the locations at which conserved charges change sign.

The IRO class has a new conserved motif downstream of the homeodomain. For the KNOX class, a conserved domain, the KNOX domain, was  defined upstream of the homeodomain. Comparison of the KNOX domain and the MEIS domain shows significant sequence similarity revealing the existence of an archetypal group of homeobox genes that encode two associated conserved domains.

Comparison with Meis1 finds two regions of high homology: a novel MH domain and the homeodomain. In imaginal discs, hth expression coincides with nuclear Exd. hth and exd also have virtually identical, mutant clonal phenotypes in adults. These results suggest that hth and exd function in the same pathway. We show that hth acts upstream of exd and is required and sufficient for Exd protein nuclear localization. We also show that hth and exd are both negative regulators of eye development; their mutant clones  caused ectopic eye formation. Targeted expression of hth, but not of exd, in the  eye disc abolished eye development completely. We suggest that hth acts with exd  to delimit the eye field and prevent inappropriate eye development.},

One set of transcription factors that are important in animal development is encoded by the homeotic (Hox) genes, which govern the choice between alternative developmental pathways along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins, such as Drosophila Ultrabithorax, have low DNA-binding specificity by themselves but gain affinity and specificity when  they bind together with the homeoprotein Extradenticle (or Pbxl in mammals). To understand the structural basis of Hox-Extradenticle pairing, we determine here the crystal structure of an Ultrabithorax-Extradenticle-DNA complex at 2.4 A resolution, using the minimal polypeptides that form a cooperative heterodimer. The Ultrabithorax and Extradenticle homeodomains bind opposite faces of the DNA,  with their DNA-recognition helices almost touching each other. However, most of the cooperative interactions arise from the YPWM amino-acid motif of Ultrabithorax-located amino-terminally to its homeodomain-which forms a reverse turn and inserts into a hydrophobic pocket on the Extradenticle homeodomain surface. Together, these protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions define the  general principles by which homeotic proteins interact with Extradenticle (or Pbx1) to affect development along the anterior-posterior axis of animals.},

Pbx proteins also stably heterodimerize and bind DNA with Meis and Pknox1-Prep1, additional members of the TALE (three-amino-acid  loop extension) superclass of homeodomain proteins that function on common genetic pathways with a subset of Hox proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that Pbx and Meis bind DNA as heterotrimeric complexes with Hoxb1 on a genetically defined Hoxb2 enhancer, r4, that mediates the cross-regulatory transcriptional effects of Hoxb1 in vivo. The DNA binding specificity of the heterotrimeric complex for r4 is mediated by a Pbx-Hox site in conjunction with a distal Meis site, which we showed to be required for ternary complex formation and Meis-enhanced transcription. Formation of heterotrimeric complexes in which all three homeodomains bind their cognate DNA sites is topologically facilitated  by the ability of Pbx and Meis to interact through their amino termini and bind DNA without stringent half-site orientation and spacing requirements. Furthermore, Meis site mutation in the Hoxb2 enhancer phenocopies Pbx-Hox site mutation to abrogate enhancer-directed expression of a reporter transgene in the  murine embryonic hindbrain, demonstrating that DNA binding by all three proteins  is required for trimer function in vivo. Our data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the combinatorial regulation of Hox and TALE protein functions that  are mediated, in part, by their interdependent DNA binding activities as ternary  complexes. As a consequence, Hoxb1 employs Pbx and Meis-related proteins, as a pair of essential cofactors in a higher-order molecular complex, to mediate its transcriptional effects on an endogenous Hox response element.},

HTH binds to DNA  as part of a HTH/Hox/EXD trimeric complex, and we show that this complex is essential for the activation of a natural Hox target enhancer. Using a dominant negative form of HTH we provide evidence that similar complexes are important for several Hox- and exd-mediated functions in vivo.

Regulatory changes both in Hox expression domains and in Hox-regulated gene networks have arisen during the evolution of related taxa, but there is little knowledge of whether functional changes in Hox proteins have also contributed to morphological evolution. For example, the evolution of greater numbers of differentiated segments and body parts in insects, compared with the simpler body plans of arthropod ancestors, may have involved an increase in the spectrum of biochemical interactions of individual Hox proteins. Here, we compare the in vivo functions of orthologous Ultrabithorax (Ubx) proteins from the insect Drosophila melanogaster and from an onychophoran, a member of a sister phylum with a more primitive and homonomous body plan. These Ubx proteins, which have been diverging in sequence for over 540 million years, can generate many of the same gain-of-function tissue transformations and can activate and repress many of the same target genes when expressed during Drosophila development. However, the  onychophora Ubx (OUbx) protein does not transform the segmental identity of the embryonic ectoderm or repress the Distal-less target gene. This functional divergence is due to sequence changes outside the conserved homeodomain region. The inability of OUbx to function like Drosophila Ubx (DUbx) in the embryonic ectoderm indicates that the Ubx protein may have acquired new cofactors or activity modifiers since the divergence of the onychophoran and insect lineages.},

Rhombomere r4-specific expression of both Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 depends upon bipartite cis Hox response elements for the group 1 paralogous proteins, Hoxal and Hoxbl. The DNA-binding ability and selectivity of these proteins depend upon  the formation of specific heterodimeric complexes with members of the PBC homeodomain protein family (Pbx genes). The r4 enhancers from Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 have the same activity, but differ with respect to the number and organisation of bipartite Pbx/Hox (PH) sites required, suggesting the intervention of other components/sequences. We report here that another family of homeodomain proteins  (TALE, Three-Amino acids-Loop-Extension: Prep1, Meis, HTH), capable of dimerizing with Pbx/EXD, is involved in the mechanisms of r4-restricted expression. We show  that: (1) the r4-specific Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 enhancers are complex elements containing separate PH and Prep/Meis (PM) sites; (2) the PM site of the Hoxb2, but not Hoxb1, enhancer is essential in vivo for r4 expression and also influences other sites of expression; (3) both PM and PH sites are required for in vitro binding of Prepl-Pbx and formation and binding of a ternary Hoxbl-Pbxla  (or 1b)-Prepl complex. (4) A similar ternary association forms in nuclear extracts from embryonal P19 cells, but only upon retinoic acid induction. This requires synthesis of Hoxbl and also contains Pbx with either Prepl or Meisl. Together these findings highlight the fact that PM sites are found in close proximity to bipartite PH motifs in several Hox responsive elements shown to be important in vivo and that such sites play an essential role in potentiating regulatory activity in combination with the PH motifs.},

	abstract = {During development of the vertebrate hindbrain, Hox genes play multiple roles in  the segmental processes that regulate anteroposterior (AP) patterning. Paralogous Hox genes, such as Hoxa3, Hoxb3 and Hoxd3, generally have very similar patterns of expression, and gene targeting experiments have shown that members of paralogy group 3 can functionally compensate for each other. Hence, distinct functions for individual members of this family may primarily depend upon differences in their  expression domains. The earliest domains of expression of the Hoxa3 and Hoxb3 genes in hindbrain rhombomeric (r) segments are transiently regulated by kreisler, a conserved Maf b-Zip protein, but the mechanisms that maintain expression in later stages are unknown. In this study, we have compared the segmental expression and regulation of Hoxa3 and Hoxb3 in mouse and chick embryos to investigate how they are controlled after initial activation. We found that the patterns of Hoxa3 and Hoxb3 expression in r5 and r6 in later stages during mouse and chick hindbrain development were differentially regulated. Hoxa3 expression was maintained in r5 and r6, while Hoxb3 was downregulated. Regulatory comparisons of cis-elements from the chick and mouse Hoxa3 locus in both transgenic mouse and chick embryos have identified a conserved enhancer that mediates the late phase of Hoxa3 expression through a conserved auto/cross-regulatory loop. This block of similarity is also present in the human and horn shark loci, and contains two bipartite Hox/Pbx-binding sites that are necessary for its in vivo activity in the hindbrain. These HOX/PBC sites are positioned near a conserved kreisler-binding site (KrA) that is involved in activating early expression in r5 and r6, but their activity is independent of kreisler. This work demonstrates that separate elements are involved in initiating and maintaining Hoxa3 expression during hindbrain segmentation, and that it is regulated in a manner different from Hoxb3 in later stages. Together,  these findings add further strength to the emerging importance of positive auto-  and cross-regulatory interactions between Hox genes as a general mechanism for maintaining their correct spatial patterns in the vertebrate nervous system.},

However,  few Hox activation domains have been identified and none characterized in detail. In this study, promotor-reporter assays in yeast and Drosophila S2 cell culture were used to refine the boundaries of the activation domain of the Drosophila Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and to identify critical elements within this domain. We found that residues 159-242 were sufficient for 50\% function, and full transactivation capacity was achieved with inclusion of additional N-terminal sequences. Activation domain sequence and placement relative to the homeodomain differ between Ubx and other Hox proteins, consistent with the possibility that diverse activation mechanisms contribute to functional distinctions in vivo. The  essential residues 159-242 in the UbxIb activation domain are predicted to contain a beta-sheet segment followed by an alpha-helix. This putative alpha-helical region was established to be necessary, but not sufficient, for transcriptional activation. Disruption of the helix by proline substitutions abolished activation function, while alteration of side chains presented on the surface of this putative helix with alanine or lysine mutations had no significant effect on activity. Collectively, these data indicate that this secondary structural element is a key component in forming an effective activation domain in the UbxIb protein. Interestingly, the alpha-helix critical for transcriptional activation is found only for Ubx orthologs from flies and not other species.

The low DNA-binding specificities of Hox proteins have raised the question of how these transcription factors selectively  regulate target gene expression. The discovery that the Extradenticle (Exd)/Pbx and Homothorax (Hth)/Meis proteins act as cofactors for several Hox proteins has  advanced the view that interactions with cofactors are critical to the target selectivity of Hox proteins. It is not clear, however, to what extent Hox proteins also regulate target genes in the absence of cofactors. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) promotes haltere development and suppresses wing development by selectively repressing many genes of the wing-patterning hierarchy, and this activity requires neither Exd nor Hth function. Here, we show that Ubx directly regulates a flight appendage-specific cis-regulatory element of the spalt (sal) gene. We find that multiple monomer Ubx-binding sites are required to completely repress this cis-element in the haltere, and that individual Ubx-binding sites are sufficient to mediate its partial repression. These results suggest that Hox proteins can directly regulate target genes in the absence of the cofactor Extradenticle. We propose that the regulation of some Hox target genes evolves via the accumulation of multiple Hox  monomer binding sites. Furthermore, because the development and morphological diversity of the distal parts of most arthropod and vertebrate appendages involve Hox, but not Exd/Pbx or Hth/Meis proteins, this mode of target gene regulation appears to be important for distal appendage development and the evolution of appendage diversity.},

	abstract = {Hox genes encode evolutionarily conserved transcription factors involved in morphological specification along the anteroposterior body axis of animals. The two most striking features of Hox genes are colinearity and the strong sequence conservation. Among all animals studied so far, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains one of the most divergent Hox clusters. The core cluster contains only four members, which in part deviate from the colinearity rule. In addition, orthologous and paralogous nematode Hox sequences diverged substantially. Given these nematode-specific features, we asked how these Hox proteins evolved and how they provide functional specificity. We investigated the role of MAB-5 during ray formation and established an in vivo assay using Cel-mab-5 regulatory elements to express orthologous, paralogous and chimeric cDNAs in a Cel-mab-5 mutant background. We show that the MAB-5 ortholog from Pristionchus pacificus, but not the C. elegans paralogous Hox proteins can rescue Cel-mab-5. Experiments with chimeric, truncated and mutagenized Hox proteins suggest the specificity to be conferred by the N-terminal arm and helix I, but not helix II of the homeodomain.},

	abstract = {Expression of the proneural gene Neurogenin2 is controlled by several enhancer elements, with the E1 element active in restricted progenitor domains in the embryonic spinal cord and telencephalon that express the homeodomain protein Pax6. We show that Pax6 function is both required and sufficient to activate this enhancer, and we identify one evolutionary conserved sequence in the E1 element with high similarity to a consensus Pax6 binding site. This conserved sequence binds Pax6 protein with low affinity both in vitro and in vivo, and its disruption results in a severe decrease in E1 activity in the spinal cord and in  its abolition in the cerebral cortex. The regulation of Neurogenin2 by Pax6 is thus direct. Pax6 is expressed in concentration gradients in both spinal cord and telencephalon. We demonstrate that the E1 element is only activated by high concentrations of Pax6 protein, and that this requirement explains the restriction of E1 enhancer activity to domains of high Pax6 expression levels in  the medioventral spinal cord and lateral cortex. By modifying the E1 enhancer sequence, we also show that the spatial pattern of enhancer activity is determined by the affinity of its binding site for Pax6. Together, these data demonstrate that direct transcriptional regulation accounts for the coordination  between mechanisms of patterning and neurogenesis. They also provide evidence that Pax6 expression gradients are involved in establishing borders of gene expression domains in different regions of the nervous system.},

Using detailed data on the breadth of both hospital and physician networks, we studied the prevalence of narrow networks and quantified the association between network breadth and premiums. Controlling for many potentially confounding factors, we found that a plan with narrow physician and hospital networks was 16 percent cheaper than a plan with broad networks for both, and that narrowing the breadth of just one type of network was associated with a 6–9 percent decrease in premiums. Narrow-network plans also have a sizable impact on federal outlays, as they depress the premium of the second-lowest-price silver plan, to which subsidy amounts are linked. Holding all else constant, we estimate that federal subsidies would have been 10.8 percent higher in 2014 had Marketplaces required all plans to offer broad provider networks. Narrow networks are a promising source of potential savings for other segments of the commercial insurance market.},

The conclusion that prices are the primary reason why the US spends more on health care than any other country remains valid, despite health policy reforms and health systems restructuring that have occurred in the US and other industrialized countries since the 2003 article’s publication. On key measures of health care resources per capita (hospital beds, physicians, and nurses), the US still provides significantly fewer resources compared to the OECD median country. Since the US is not consuming greater resources than other countries, the most logical factor is the higher prices paid in the US. Because the differential between what the public and private sectors pay for medical services has grown significantly in the past fifteen years, US policy makers should focus on prices in the private sector.},

	abstract = {Background The United States is the only high-income nation without universal, government-funded or -mandated health insurance employing a unified payment system. The US multi-payer system leaves residents uninsured or underinsured, despite overall healthcare costs far above other nations. Single-payer (often referred to as Medicare for All), a proposed policy solution since 1990, is receiving renewed press attention and popular support. Our review seeks to assess the projected cost impact of a single-payer approach. Methods and findings We conducted our literature search between June 1 and December 31, 2018, without start date restriction for included studies. We surveyed an expert panel and searched PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, and preexisting lists for formal economic studies of the projected costs of single-payer plans for the US or for individual states. Reviewer pairs extracted data on methods and findings using a template. We quantified changes in total costs standardized to percentage of contemporaneous healthcare spending. Additionally, we quantified cost changes by subtype, such as costs due to increased healthcare utilization and savings due to simplified payment administration, lower drug costs, and other factors. We further examined how modeling assumptions affected results. Our search yielded economic analyses of the cost of 22 single-payer plans over the past 30 years. Exclusions were due to inadequate technical data or assuming a substantial ongoing role for private insurers. We found that 19 (86\%) of the analyses predicted net savings (median net result was a savings of 3.46\% of total costs) in the first year of program operation and 20 (91\%) predicted savings over several years; anticipated growth rates would result in long-term net savings for all plans. The largest source of savings was simplified payment administration (median 8.8\%), and the best predictors of net savings were the magnitude of utilization increase, and savings on administration and drug costs (R2 of 0.035, 0.43, and 0.62, respectively). Only drug cost savings remained significant in multivariate analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in methods, which precluded us from conducting a formal meta-analysis. Conclusions In this systematic review, we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single-payer approach in the US. Actual costs will depend on plan features and implementation. Future research should refine estimates of the effects of coverage expansion on utilization, evaluate provider administrative costs in varied existing single-payer systems, analyze implementation options, and evaluate US-based single-payer programs, as available.},

	abstract = {Polypharmacy situations, which is the use of multiple concomitant drugs to treat a medical condition, is recognized as social problem. The concomitant use of 2 or more drugs increases the risk of AEs. This problem is generally known as drug-drug interactions (DDIs), the proportion of AEs due to DDIs is estimated to be up to 30\% of unexpected AEs. In pre-marketing randomized clinical trials, patients on multiple drug use are usually excluded because the focus is on establishing the safety and efficacy of a single drug and not on investigating drug-drug interactions (DDIs). However, unlike pre-marketing randomized clinical trials, in clinical practice (= post marketing), many patients use multiple drugs, as in polypharmacy situations. The spontaneous reporting systems are a crucial source of post-marketing drug safety surveillance and are commonly used to detect suspected drug-induced adverse events (AEs) and generate hypothesized unknown drug-induced AEs in real-world settings. Recently, not only methodological studies on signal detection of “single” drug, but also on several methodological studies on signal detection of DDIs have been conducted. On the other hand, there are few articles that systematically summarize the statistical methodology for signal detection of DDIs. Therefore, this article reviews the studies on the latest statistical methodologies from classical methodologies for signal detection of DDIs using spontaneous reporting system. This article describes how to calculate for each detection method and the major findings from the published literatures about DDIs. Finally, this article presented some of the challenges related to the currently used methodologies for signal detection of DDIs and suggestions for further studies.},

We find the following:  Many adults are ambivalent about (neither support nor oppose) Medicare for All and other proposals to expand health insurance coverage, though support for these proposals tends to be greater than opposition. Young adults, nonwhite and Hispanic adults, those with low incomes, and those without private health insurance are more likely to support than oppose Medicare for All. Those who neither support nor oppose Medicare for All share many of these characteristics. Medicare for All supporters and opponents have different perceptions of how it will affect access to care, with the perceptions of those who are ambivalent about the policy closer to those of supporters. Medicare for All supporters cite universal health coverage and greater affordability as important factors in their support. Higher taxes and concerns about wait times to see health care providers and quality of care are more important to Medicare for All opponents.},

	abstract = {The United States has been singularly unsuccessful at controlling health care spending. During the past four decades, American policymakers and analysts have embraced an ever changing array of panaceas to control costs, including managed care, consumer-directed health care, and most recently, delivery system reform and value-based purchasing. Past panaceas have gone through a cycle of excessive hope followed by disappointment at their failure to rein in medical care spending. We argue that accountable care organizations, medical homes, and similar ideas in vogue today could repeat this pattern. We explain why the United States persistently pursues health policy fads—despite their poor record—and how the promotion of panaceas obscures critical debate about controlling health care costs. Americans spend too much time on the quest for the “holy grail”—a reform that will decisively curtail spending while simultaneously improving quality of care—and too little time learning from the experiences of others. Reliable cost control does not, contrary to conventional wisdom, require fundamental delivery system reform or an end to fee-for-service payment. It does require the U.S. to emulate the lessons of other nations that have been more successful at limiting spending through budgeting, systemwide fee schedules, and concentrated purchasing.},

	abstract = {We are currently experiencing an era that is facing increasing global environmental and societal problems (e.g., climate change, habitat destruction and economic recession). Scientific research projects are often required to emphasize and counter the effects of inequity and globalisation, and prioritise cooperation supported by cooperative research. This paper investigates whether publication of research that is carried out in least developed countries is done in cooperation with research institutes from these countries. The study uses the Current Contents database of peer-reviewed publications from more than 7,000 journals in all sciences (Biology and environmental sciences; Physical, chemical and earth sciences; Engineering, computing and technology; Life sciences; Clinical medicine; Arts and humanities; Social and behavioral sciences) published between 1 January 1999 and 3 November 2000. From a total of 1,601,196 papers published, 2,798 articles of research activities carried out in the 48 least developed countries were selected using title information as an indicator. Collaborative relationships between research institutions involved was then analysed within and between countries and sciences. Our results show that publications of research, carried out in the least developed countries, do not have co-authorship of local research institutes in 70\% of the cases, and that a majority of the papers is published by research institutes from the most industrialised countries in the world. We employed the use of questionnaires sent to authors from papers in the above-mentioned database to detect possible causes of this high percentage of lack of authorship in the essential academic currency that 'publications' are. 'Neo-colonial science' is identified as one of them. In addition, there exists a large discrepancy between what the surveyed scientists say they find important in international collaboration and joint publishing, and the way they act to it. However, the interpretation given to the fact that institutional co-authorship is underrepresented for local research institutions in the least developed countries is less important than the fact itself, and future research should concentrate on a scientific way to equilibrate this adverse trend.},

	abstract = {The ideal of combining biomedicine with traditional, complementary and/or alternative medicine (CAM) is now widespread in global healthcare systems. Called integrative medicine (IM) or integrative healthcare (IHC), biomedicine and CAM are being combined in myriad healthcare settings; select medical curricula are incorporating CAM while new ‘integrative’ physicians are graduating; and widescale health policy on CAM is being created by such organisations as the World Health Organization (WHO). While the IM trend is fast developing, little theory has been applied to examining the epistemology of this new health phenomenon and if, in fact, integration between divergent health paradigms is possible. Drawing on an anti-colonial analysis of new IM settings in Canada, we suggest that fundamental challenges exist to integrating biomedicine and CAM that have been largely ignored in the push for integration. They are: (a) the devaluing of non-biomedical health knowledges; (b) accepting only biomedical evidence; and (c) the creation of a biomedical monolithic worldview. As a part of paradigm appropriation and assimilation, we trace these challenges to the colonial devaluation of Indigenous knowledge. We argue that an anti-colonial analysis of IM provides the ‘missing link’ to understanding the fundamental processes through which biomedicine appropriates CAM, and the reasons it continues to do so.},

This projected increase in federal healthcare commitments would equal approximately 10.7 percent of GDP in 2022, rising to nearly 12.7 percent of GDP in 2031 and further thereafter. Doubling all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan. It is likely that the actual cost of M4A would be substantially greater than these estimates, which assume significant administrative and drug cost savings under the plan, and also assume that healthcare providers operating under M4A will be reimbursed at rates more than 40 percent lower than those currently paid by private health insurance.},

We estimated physician practices in Ontario spent \$22,205 per physician per year interacting with Canada’s single-payer agency—just 27 percent of the \$82,975 per physician per year spent in the United States. US nursing staff, including medical assistants, spent 20.6 hours per physician per week interacting with health plans—nearly ten times that of their Ontario counterparts. If US physicians had administrative costs similar to those of Ontario physicians, the total savings would be approximately \$27.6 billion per year.

We assembled a team of international health policy experts to conduct just such a challenging analysis of hospital administrative costs across eight nations: Canada, England, Scotland, Wales, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States. We found that administrative costs accounted for 25.3 percent of total US hospital expenditures—a percentage that is increasing. Next highest were the Netherlands (19.8 percent) and England (15.5 percent), both of which are transitioning to market-oriented payment systems. Scotland and Canada, whose single-payer systems pay hospitals global operating budgets, with separate grants for capital, had the lowest administrative costs. Costs were intermediate in France and Germany (which bill per patient but pay separately for capital projects) and in Wales. Reducing US per capita spending for hospital administration to Scottish or Canadian levels would have saved more than \$150 billion in 2011. This study suggests that the reduction of US administrative costs would best be accomplished through the use of a simpler and less market-oriented payment scheme.},

When data were not available for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from sources other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In 2016, the US spent 17.8\% of its gross domestic product on health care, and spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6\% (Australia) to 12.4\% (Switzerland). The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90\% in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99\%-100\%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3\%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4\% of the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6\%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1\% (range for other countries, 23.8\%-63.4\%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6\%). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43\% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100 000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100 000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8\% in the US vs a range of 1\% to 3\% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending per capita was \$1443 in the US vs a range of \$466 to \$939 in other countries. Salaries of physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, generalist physicians salaries were \$218 173 in the US compared with a range of \$86 607 to \$154 126 in the other countries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The United States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as these are needed to inform policy decisions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a major challenge in drug development. Previous attempts have established formal approaches for pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs, but there is not a feasible solution for pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs because the endpoint is often a serious adverse event rather than a measurable change in drug concentration. Here, we developed a metric “S-score” that measures the strength of network connection between drug targets to predict PD DDIs. Utilizing known PD DDIs as golden standard positives (GSPs), we observed a significant correlation between S-score and the likelihood a PD DDI occurs. Our prediction was robust and surpassed existing methods as validated by two independent GSPs. Analysis of clinical side effect data suggested that the drugs having predicted DDIs have similar side effects. We further incorporated this clinical side effects evidence with S-score to increase the prediction specificity and sensitivity through a Bayesian probabilistic model. We have predicted 9,626 potential PD DDIs at the accuracy of 82\% and the recall of 62\%. Importantly, our algorithm provided opportunities for better understanding the potential molecular mechanisms or physiological effects underlying DDIs, as illustrated by the case studies., Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is an important problem in clinical practice. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm for systematically predicting pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs through protein-protein-interaction (PPI) networks. We calculated a score to predict potential PD DDIs by integrating the information from drug-target associations, PPI network topology and cross-tissue gene expression correlations. The scoring system was validated by known PD DDIs and agreed with similarities in drug clinical side effects, which we further integrated to increase the prediction performance. Our approach not only outperformed previously published methods in predicting DDIs, but also provided opportunities for better understanding the potential molecular mechanisms or physiological consequences underlying DDIs.},

Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks.

This year's update, DrugBank 5.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in more than 10 years. In many cases, existing data content has grown by 100\% or more over the last update. For instance, the total number of investigational drugs in the database has grown by almost 300\%, the number of drug-drug interactions has grown by nearly 600\% and the number of SNP-associated drug effects has grown more than 3000\%. Significant improvements have been made to the quantity, quality and consistency of drug indications, drug binding data as well as drug-drug and drug-food interactions. A great deal of brand new data have also been added to DrugBank 5.0. This includes information on the influence of hundreds of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics), gene expression levels (pharmacotranscriptomics) and protein expression levels (pharmacoprotoemics). New data have also been added on the status of hundreds of new drug clinical trials and existing drug repurposing trials. Many other important improvements in the content, interface and performance of the DrugBank website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use, utility and potential applications in many areas of pharmacological research, pharmaceutical science and drug education.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Unlike several other national health agencies, French health authorities recommended that the newer direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agents only be prescribed as second choice for the treatment of newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) remaining the first choice. We investigated the patterns of use of DOACs versus VKA in the treatment of NVAF in France over the first 5 years of DOAC availability. We also identified the changes in patient characteristics of those  who initiated DOAC treatment over this time period. METHODS: Based on the French  National Health Administrative Database, we constituted a population-based cohort of all patients who were newly treated for NVAF between January 2011 and December 2015. Trends in drug use were described as the percentage of patients initiating  each drug at the time of treatment initiation. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression model was performed to identify independent sociodemographic  and clinical predictors of initial anticoagulant choice. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 814 446 patients who had received a new anticoagulant treatment for NVAF. The proportion of patients using DOACs as initial anticoagulant therapy reached 54\% 3 months after the Health Ministry approved the reimbursement of dabigatran for NVAF, and 61\% by the end of 2015, versus VKA use. In the multivariate analysis, we found that DOAC initiators were younger and healthier overall than VKA initiators, and this tendency was reinforced over the 2011-2014  period. DOACs were more frequently prescribed by cardiologists in 2012 and after  (adjusted OR in 2012: 2.47; 95\% CI 2.40 to 2.54). CONCLUSION: Despite recommendations from health authorities, DOACs have been rapidly and massively adopted as initial therapy for NVAF in France. Observational studies should account for the fact that patients selected to initiate DOAC treatment are healthier overall, as failure to do so may bias the risk-benefit assessment of DOACs.},

Many forces, including numerous positive trial results, emerging safety concerns, marketing, and promotion, may shape DOAC adoption by providers. However, relatively little is known regarding their ambulatory utilization compared with warfarin, as well as the degree to which they have decreased under-treatment of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We used the IMS Health National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a nationally representative audit of outpatient office visits, to estimate the use of warfarin and DOACs between 2009 and 2014. RESULTS: Overall, visits with anticoagulation use increased from 2.05 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-2.27) to 2.83 (95\% CI, 2.49-3.17) million (M) quarterly visits (P {\textless} .001). Of these, DOAC use has grown to 4.21M (95\% CI, 3.63M-4.79M; 38.2\% of total) treatment visits in 2014 since their introduction in 2010. Use of all oral anticoagulants in treatment visits for atrial fibrillation has increased from 0.88M (95\% CI, 0.74M-1.02M) to 1.72M (95\% CI, 1.47M-1.97M; P {\textless} .001), with similar DOAC and warfarin use in 2014. Atrial fibrillation visits with anticoagulant use increased from 51.9\% (95\% CI, 50.4\%-53.8\%) to 66.9\% (95\% CI, 65.0\%-69.3\%) between 2009 and 2014 (P {\textless} .001). In 2014, rivaroxaban was the most  commonly prescribed DOAC for atrial fibrillation (47.9\% of office visits), followed by apixaban (26.5\%) and dabigatran (25.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: Direct oral anticoagulants have been adopted rapidly, matching the use of warfarin, and are associated with increased use of oral anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation.},

	abstract = {Background: Adverse events (AEs) can be caused not only by one drug but also by the interaction between two or more drugs. Therefore, clarifying whether an AE is due to a specific suspect drug or drug-drug interaction (DDI) is useful information for proper use of drugs. Whereas previous reports on the search for drug-induced AEs with signal detection using spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are numerous, reports on drug interactions are limited. This is because in methods that use "a safety signal indicator" (signal), which is frequently used in pharmacovigilance, a huge number of combinations must be prepared when signal  detection is performed, and each risk index must be calculated, which makes interaction search appear unrealistic. Objective: In this paper, we propose association rule mining (AR) using large dataset analysis as an alternative to the conventional methods (additive interaction model (AI) and multiplicative interaction model (MI)). Methods: The data source used was the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. The combination of drugs for which the risk index is  detected by the "combination risk ratio (CR)" as the target was assumed to be true data, and the accuracy of signal detection using the AR methods was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, F-score. Results: Our experimental results targeting Stevens-Johnson syndrome indicate that AR has  a sensitivity of 99.05\%, specificity of 92.60\%, Youden's index of 0.917, F-score  of 0.876, AI has a sensitivity of 95.62\%, specificity of 96.92\%, Youden's index of 0.925, and F-score of 0.924, and MI has a sensitivity of 65.46\%, specificity of 98.78\%, Youden's index of 0.642, and F-score of 0.771. This result was about the same level as or higher than the conventional method. Conclusions: If you use similar calculation methods to create combinations from the database, not only for SJS, but for all AEs, the number of combinations would be so enormous that it would be difficult to perform the calculations. However, in the AR method, the "Apriori algorithm" is used to reduce the number of calculations. Thus, the proposed method has the same detection power as the conventional methods, with the significant advantage that its calculation process is simple.},

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

These shared features were used to identify a neurogenic enhancer in the distantly related Anopheles genome. We suggest that the constrained organization of metazoan enhancers may be essential for their ability to produce precise patterns of gene expression during development.

	abstract = {Transcriptional activation of germline (GL) promoters occurs through binding of NF-kappaB to three evolutionarily conserved sites within a CD40 response region in the human and mouse GL Igamma and Iepsilon promoters. Here we identify and characterize a novel NF-kappaB binding site (kappaB6) within the human GL Igamma1 promoter that plays an essential role in basal- and CD40-induced transcription. This site is adjacent to identified CREB/activating transcription factor (ATF) sites, present in the Igamma1 but not the Igamma3 promoter, which are important for the amplification of transcription. Our data suggest a cohesive protein complex regulating Igamma1 promoter activity because disruption of any individual NF-kappaB or CREB/ATF site markedly lowers the overall inducible activity of the promoter. In addition, alteration of helical phasing within the promoter indicates spatial orientation of CREB/ATF and NF-kappaB, proteins contributes directly to promoter activity. We found that CREB and p50 transactivators, as well as coactivator p300, interact in vivo with the Igamma1 promoter in the presence and absence of CD40 signaling in Ramos and primary B cells. However, the level of CREB and p300 binding differs as a consequence of activation in primary B cells. Furthermore, overexpression of p300, and not a mutant lacking acetyltransferase activity, significantly increases Igamma1 construct-specific transcription. Together these data support a model whereby CREB and multiple NF-kappaB complexes bind to the Igamma1 promoter and recruit p300. CD40 signals induce p300-dependent changes that result in optimal Igamma1 promoter activity.},

A distinct set of activators including ATF-2, c-jun, Ets, Sp1, Egr-1 and the coactivator proteins CBP/p300 are recruited to the TNF-alpha promoter after stimulation with M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the formation of this enhanceosome is dependent on inducer-specific helical phasing relationships between transcription factor binding sites. We also show that the transcriptional activity of CBP/p300 is potentiated by mycobacterial stimulation of monocytes. The identification of TNF-alpha regulatory elements and coactivators involved in M. tuberculosis-stimulated gene expression thus provides potential selective molecular targets in the modulation of TNF-alpha gene expression in the setting of mycobacterial infection.},

SP-B is expressed in a cell-type specific manner by the alveolar type II and bronchiolar (Clara) epithelial cells of the lung and is developmentally induced. Our previous studies showed that the activity of the rabbit SP-B minimal promoter (-236/+39 bp) is dependent on the binding of an array of transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, thyroid transcription factor 1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 and activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP response element binding protein. The SP-B minimal promoter sequence as well as the spacing and orientations of cis-DNA elements are conserved in human, rabbit and mouse SP-B genes. In the present study, we investigated the importance of spacing and orientation of cis-DNA elements on SP-B promoter function in NCI-H441 cells, a human cell line of Clara cell lineage. Further we investigated the effects of transcription factors on SP-B promoter expression by co-transfection experiments. Results showed that disruptions of helical phasing and orientation of cis-DNA elements reduced SP-B promoter activity indicating that proper alignment and orientation of cis-DNA elements are necessary for SP-B promoter function. Co-transfection experiments showed that transcription factors function in a combinatorial rather than in a synergistic manner to enhance SP-B promoter activity.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that multiple serum response factor (SRF)-binding CArG elements were required for smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific regulation of smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin expression. However, a critical question remains as to the mechanisms whereby a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor such as SRF might contribute to SMC-specific expression. The goal of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that SMC-selective expression of SM alpha-actin is due at least in part to (1) unique CArG flanking sequences that distinguish the SM alpha-actin CArGs from other ubiquitously expressed CArG-dependent genes such as c-fos, (2) cooperative interactions between CArG elements, and (3) SRF-dependent binding of SMC-selective proteins to the CArG-containing regions of the promoter. Results demonstrated that specific sequences flanking CArG B were important for promoter activity in SMCs but not in bovine aortic endothelial cells. We also provided evidence indicating that the structural orientation between CArGs A and B was an important determinant of promoter function. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and methylation interference footprinting demonstrated that a unique SRF-containing complex formed that was selective for SMCs and, furthermore, that this complex was probably stabilized by protein-protein interactions and not by specific interactions with CArG flanking sequences. Taken together, the results of these studies provide evidence that SM alpha-actin expression in SMCs is complex and may involve the formation of a unique multiprotein initiation complex that is coordinated by SRF complexes bound to multiple CArG elements.},

We used deletion experiments to show that a core enhancer element cooperates, in a specific helical phasing, with distant essential factors binding to the ends of the enhancer. This core sequence, binding a Jun B/Fra-2 heterodimer, cooperatively recruits the architectural protein HMG-I(Y) in a nucleoprotein complex, where they interact with each other.

Both in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies further demonstrate interaction between Cbfa1 with c-Fos and c-Jun in the absence of phosphorylation and without binding to DNA. Additionally, only the runt domain of Cbfa1 was required for interaction with c-Jun and c-Fos. In mammalian cells, overexpression of Cbfa1 enhanced c-Jun activation of AP-1-binding site promoter activity, demonstrating functional interaction. Finally, insertion of base pairs that disrupted the helical phasing between the AP-1- and RD-binding sites also inhibited collagenase-3 promoter activation. Thus, we provide direct evidence that Cbfa1 and c-Fos.c-Jun physically interact and cooperatively bind the AP-1- and RD-binding sites in the collagenase-3 promoter.

To characterize additional proteins that interact with boundary elements, we have isolated a protein that binds to two of these boundary elements (BE76 and BE28) and have identified it as the transcription factor DREF. We present evidence that BEAF and DREF compete for binding to overlapping binding sites, and that this competition occurs in vivo. DREF is believed to regulate genes whose products are involved in DNA replication and cell proliferation, suggesting that the activation of transcription predicted to result from the displacement of BEAF by DREF might be limited to certain rapidly proliferating tissues.

Little is known, however, how factors such as Gli are transported into the nucleus and how this may be regulated by interaction with other cellular factors, such as the negative regulator suppressor of fused (SuFu). In the present study we show for the first time that nuclear entry of Gli1 is regulated by a unique mechanism through mutually exclusive binding by its nuclear import factor Impβ1 (importin β1) and SuFu. Using quantitative live mammalian cell imaging, we show that nuclear accumulation of GFP-Gli1 fusion proteins, but not of a control protein, is specifically inhibited by co-expression of SuFu. Using a direct binding assay, we show that Impβ1 exhibits a high nanomolar affinity to Gli1, with specific knockdown of Impβ1 expression being able to inhibit Gli1 nuclear accumulation, thus implicating Impβ1 as the nuclear transporter for Gli1 for the first time. SuFu also binds to Gli1 with a high nanomolar affinity, intriguingly being able to compete with Impβ1 for binding to Gli1, through the fact that the sites for SuFu and Impβ1 binding overlap at the Gli1 N-terminus. The results indicate for the first time that the relative intracellular concentrations of SuFu and Impβ1 are likely to determine the localization of Gli1, with implications for its action in cancer, as well as in developmental systems.},

The CD4 promoter does not contain functionally redundant sites: all four factor-binding sites must be intact to achieve wild-type activity. Here we demonstrate that the precise position of three factor-binding sites relative to each other is essential for promoter activity, indicating that they function together as an inseparable cassette for assembly of the transcription initiation complex. Small changes in either phasing or distance between any two sites in this cassette leads to complete abrogation of promoter function. In addition, we demonstrate that one of the factors that bind the promoter cassette is not present in CD8 SP T(C) cells. Thus, this factor is a candidate for mediating the relative subclass specificity of CD4 promoter function in activated CD4 SP T(H) cells.},

Since TFs bind degenerate DNA sequences, discriminating functional TF binding sites (TFBSs) from background sequences represents a significant challenge. Here, we show that a Drosophila regulatory element that activates Epidermal Growth Factor signaling requires overlapping, low-affinity TFBSs for competing TFs (Pax2 and Senseless) to ensure cell- and segment-specific activity. Testing available TF binding models for Pax2 and Senseless, however, revealed variable accuracy in predicting such low-affinity TFBSs. To better define parameters that increase accuracy, we developed a method that systematically selects subsets of TFBSs based on predicted affinity to generate hundreds of position-weight matrices (PWMs). Counterintuitively, we found that degenerate PWMs produced from datasets depleted of high-affinity sequences were more accurate in identifying both low- and high-affinity TFBSs for the Pax2 and Senseless TFs. Taken together, these findings reveal how TFBS arrangement can be constrained by competition rather than cooperativity and that degenerate models of TF binding preferences can improve identification of biologically relevant low affinity TFBSs.},

Here, combining bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and transcription activator-like effector (TALE) technologies, we developed a novel method for labeling genomic loci (BiFC-TALE), which largely reduces the background fluorescence level.

Most appear to regulate their neighbouring genes, suggesting that the cis-regulatory genome is organized locally into domains, which are supported by chromosomal domains, insulator binding and genome evolution. However, 12 to 21 per cent of enhancers appear to skip non-expressed neighbours and regulate a more distal gene. Finally, we computationally identify cis-regulatory motifs that are predictive and required for enhancer activity, as we validate experimentally.

	abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units ("wordpieces") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of "character"-delimited models and the efficiency of "word"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60\% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.},

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent large-scale chromatin states mapping efforts have revealed characteristic chromatin modification signatures for various types of functional DNA elements. Given the important influence of chromatin states on gene regulation and the rapid accumulation of genome-wide chromatin modification data, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze these data in order to identify functional DNA elements. However, existing computational tools do not exploit data transformation and feature extraction as a means to achieve a more accurate prediction.
RESULTS: We introduce a new computational framework for identifying functional DNA elements using chromatin signatures. The framework consists of a data transformation and a feature extraction step followed by a classification step using time-delay neural network. We implemented our framework in a software tool CSI-ANN (chromatin signature identification by artificial neural network). When applied to predict transcriptional enhancers in the ENCODE region, CSI-ANN achieved a 65.5\% sensitivity and 66.3\% positive predictive value, a 5.9\% and 11.6\% improvement, respectively, over the previously best approach.

	abstract = {Transcription regulation in multicellular eukaryotes is orchestrated by a number of DNA functional elements located at gene regulatory regions. Some regulatory regions (e.g. enhancers) are located far away from the gene they affect. Identification of distal regulatory elements is a challenge for the bioinformatics research. Although existing methodologies increased the number of computationally predicted enhancers, performance inconsistency of computational models across different cell-lines, class imbalance within the learning sets and ad hoc rules for selecting enhancer candidates for supervised learning, are some key questions that require further examination. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data. We report the first computational enhancer prediction results on FANTOM5 data where DEEP achieves 90.2\% accuracy and 90\% geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity across 36 different tissues. We further present results derived using in vivo-derived enhancer data from VISTA database. DEEP-VISTA, when tested on an independent test set, achieved GM of 80.1\% and accuracy of 89.64\%.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of deep sequencing techniques in the recent years, enhancers have been systematically identified in such projects as FANTOM and ENCODE, forming genome-wide landscapes in a series of human cell lines. Nevertheless, experimental approaches are still costly and time consuming for large scale identification of enhancers across a variety of tissues under different disease status, making computational identification of enhancers indispensable.
RESULTS: To facilitate the identification of enhancers, we propose a computational framework, named DeepEnhancer, to distinguish enhancers from background genomic sequences. Our method purely relies on DNA sequences to predict enhancers in an end-to-end manner by using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We train our deep learning model on permissive enhancers and then adopt a transfer learning strategy to fine-tune the model on enhancers specific to a cell line. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in the classification of enhancers against random sequences, exhibiting advantages of deep learning over traditional sequence-based classifiers. We then construct a variety of neural networks with different architectures and show the usefulness of such techniques as max-pooling and batch normalization in our method. To gain the interpretability of our approach, we further visualize convolutional kernels as sequence logos and successfully identify similar motifs in the JASPAR database.
CONCLUSIONS: DeepEnhancer enables the identification of novel enhancers using only DNA sequences via a highly accurate deep learning model. The proposed computational framework can also be applied to similar problems, thereby prompting the use of machine learning methods in life sciences.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Histone modifications are among the most important factors that control gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expression from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their combinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing 'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels either failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods that separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a unified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to classify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system, called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among important features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions among histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique that generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides an intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate genes.
RESULTS: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models like Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression classification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The output of our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations but also allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histone modification marks, some of which have recently been observed by experimental studies.

Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications.
RESULTS: We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.

This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory 'grammar' to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models.

Because of the large number of candidates and the imperfection of the screening methods, many spurious CRMs are detected that are as high scoring as the biologically true ones. Using ChIP-information allows not only to reduce the regions in which the binding sites of the assayed transcription factor (TF) should be located, but also allows restricting the valid CRMs to those that contain the assayed TF (here referred to as applying CRM detection in a query-based mode). In this study, we show that exploiting ChIP-information in a query-based way makes in silico CRM detection a much more feasible endeavor. To be able to handle the large datasets, the query-based setting and other specificities proper to CRM detection on ChIP-Seq based data, we developed a novel powerful CRM detection method 'CPModule'. By applying it on a well-studied ChIP-Seq data set involved in self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate how our tool can recover combinatorial regulation of five known TFs that are key in the self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells. Additionally, we make a number of new predictions on combinatorial regulation of these five key TFs with other TFs documented in TRANSFAC.},

Here, we explore the potential of elucidating regulatory systems in varied cell types using computational techniques that rely on only data of gene expression, low-resolution chromatin accessibility, and TF-DNA binding specificities ('motifs'). We show that static computational motif scans overlaid with chromatin accessibility data reasonably approximate experimentally measured TF-DNA binding. We demonstrate that predicted binding profiles and expression patterns of hundreds of TFs are sufficient to identify major regulators of ∼200 spatiotemporal expression domains in the Drosophila embryo. We are then able to learn reliable statistical models of enhancer activity for over 70 expression domains and apply those models to annotate domain specific enhancers genome-wide. Throughout this work, we apply our motif and accessibility based approach to comprehensively characterize the regulatory network of fruitfly embryonic development and show that the accuracy of our computational method compares favorably to approaches that rely on data from many experimental assays.},

	abstract = {Oligomers of length k, or k-mers, are convenient and widely used features for modeling the properties and functions of DNA and protein sequences. However, k-mers suffer from the inherent limitation that if the parameter k is increased to resolve longer features, the probability of observing any specific k-mer becomes very small, and k-mer counts approach a binary variable, with most k-mers absent and a few present once. Thus, any statistical learning approach using k-mers as features becomes susceptible to noisy training set k-mer frequencies once k becomes large. To address this problem, we introduce alternative feature sets using gapped k-mers, a new classifier, gkm-SVM, and a general method for robust estimation of k-mer frequencies. To make the method applicable to large-scale genome wide applications, we develop an efficient tree data structure for computing the kernel matrix. We show that compared to our original kmer-SVM and alternative approaches, our gkm-SVM predicts functional genomic regulatory elements and tissue specific enhancers with significantly improved accuracy, increasing the precision by up to a factor of two. We then show that gkm-SVM consistently outperforms kmer-SVM on human ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, and further demonstrate the general utility of our method using a Naïve-Bayes classifier.

Identifying the cis-regulatory elements responsible for this tightly orchestrated regulation of gene expression is an essential step in understanding the genetic pathways involved in development. We describe a strategy to systematically identify tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements that share combinations of sequence motifs. Using heart development as an experimental framework, we employed a combination of Gibbs sampling and linear regression to build a classifier that identifies heart enhancers based on the presence and/or absence of various sequence features, including known and putative transcription factor (TF) binding specificities. In distinguishing heart enhancers from a large pool of random noncoding sequences, the performance of our classifier is vastly superior to four commonly used methods, with an accuracy reaching 92\% in cross-validation. Furthermore, most of the binding specificities learned by our method resemble the specificities of TFs widely recognized as key players in heart development and differentiation, such as SRF, MEF2, ETS1, SMAD, and GATA. Using our classifier as a predictor, a genome-wide scan identified over 40,000 novel human heart enhancers. Although the classifier used no gene expression information, these novel enhancers are strongly associated with genes expressed in the heart. Finally, in vivo tests of our predictions in mouse and zebrafish achieved a validation rate of 62\%, significantly higher than what is expected by chance. These results support the existence of underlying cis-regulatory codes dictating tissue-specific transcription in mammalian genomes and validate our enhancer classifier strategy as a method to uncover these regulatory codes.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances in experimental approaches for identifying transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, 'enhancers'), direct empirical discovery of CRMs for all genes in all cell types and environmental conditions is likely to remain an elusive goal. Effective methods for computational CRM discovery are thus a critically needed complement to empirical approaches. However, existing computational methods that search for clusters of putative binding sites are ineffective if the relevant TFs and/or their binding specificities are unknown. Here, we provide a significantly improved method for 'motif-blind' CRM discovery that does not depend on knowledge or accurate prediction of TF-binding motifs and is effective when limited knowledge of functional CRMs is available to 'supervise' the search. We propose a new statistical method, based on 'Interpolated Markov Models', for motif-blind, genome-wide CRM discovery. It captures the statistical profile of variable length words in known CRMs of a regulatory network and finds candidate CRMs that match this profile. The method also uses orthologs of the known CRMs from closely related genomes. We perform in silico evaluation of predicted CRMs by assessing whether their neighboring genes are enriched for the expected expression patterns. This assessment uses a novel statistical test that extends the widely used Hypergeometric test of gene set enrichment to account for variability in intergenic lengths. We find that the new CRM prediction method is superior to existing methods. Finally, we experimentally validate 12 new CRM predictions by examining their regulatory activity in vivo in Drosophila; 10 of the tested CRMs were found to be functional, while 6 of the top 7 predictions showed the expected activity patterns.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the rapid emergence of technologies for locating cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) genome-wide, the next pressing challenge is to assign precise functions to each CRM, i.e. to determine the spatiotemporal domains or cell-types where it drives expression. A popular approach to this task is to model the typical k-mer composition of a set of CRMs known to drive a common expression pattern, and assign that pattern to other CRMs exhibiting a similar k-mer composition. This approach does not rely on prior knowledge of transcription factors relevant to the CRM or their binding motifs, and is thus more widely applicable than motif-based methods for predicting CRM activity, but is also prone to false positive predictions.
RESULTS: We present a novel strategy to improve the above-mentioned approach: to predict if a CRM drives a specific gene expression pattern, assess not only how similar the CRM is to other CRMs with similar activity but also to CRMs with distinct activities. We use a state-of-the-art statistical method to quantify a CRM's sequence similarity to many different training sets of CRMs, and employ a classification algorithm to integrate these similarity scores into a single prediction of the CRM's activity. This strategy is shown to significantly improve CRM activity prediction over current approaches.

	abstract = {Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-specific colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

Activation by low levels of dl in lateral regions (the presumptive neuroectoderm) depends on cooperative DNA binding interactions between dl and bHLH proteins. The snail repressor blocks this interaction and restricts expression to the neuroectoderm.

Both sets of genes share an 11-base pair (bp) activator motif. Broadly expressed genes contain a palindromic version that mediates expression in all photoreceptors. In contrast, each Rhodopsin exhibits characteristic single-bp substitutions that break the symmetry of the palindrome and generate activator or repressor motifs critical for restricting expression to photoreceptor subsets.

	abstract = {Lens induction is a classical developmental model allowing investigation of cell specification, spatiotemporal control of gene expression, as well as how transcription factors are integrated into highly complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Pax6 represents a key node in the gene regulatory network governing mammalian lens induction. Meis1 and Meis2 homeoproteins are considered as essential upstream regulators of Pax6 during lens morphogenesis based on their interaction with the ectoderm enhancer (EE) located upstream of Pax6 transcription start site. Despite this generally accepted regulatory pathway, Meis1-, Meis2- and EE-deficient mice have surprisingly mild eye phenotypes at placodal stage of lens development. Here, we show that simultaneous deletion of Meis1 and Meis2 in presumptive lens ectoderm results in arrested lens development in the pre-placodal stage, and neither lens placode nor lens is formed. We found that in the presumptive lens ectoderm of Meis1/Meis2 deficient embryos Pax6 expression is absent. We demonstrate using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that in addition to EE, Meis homeoproteins bind to a remote, ultraconserved SIMO enhancer of Pax6. We further show, using in vivo gene reporter analyses, that the lens-specific activity of SIMO enhancer is dependent on the presence of three Meis binding sites, phylogenetically conserved from man to zebrafish. Genetic ablation of EE and SIMO enhancers demostrates their requirement for lens induction and uncovers an apparent redundancy at early stages of lens development. These findings identify a genetic requirement for Meis1 and Meis2 during the early steps of mammalian eye development. Moreover, they reveal an apparent robustness in the gene regulatory mechanism whereby two independent "shadow enhancers" maintain critical levels of a dosage-sensitive gene, Pax6, during lens induction.},

Our locus-wide dissections of the cis-regulatory landscapes of fly patched and mouse Ptch1 reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The seemingly simple, constitutive Hedgehog response of patched/Ptch1 is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. This structure-one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes-explains how patched/Ptch1 can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function.

Related enhancers colocalize to the same microenvironments independently of their chromosomal location, suggesting that microenvironments are highly differentiated transcription domains. Manipulating the affinity of svb enhancers revealed an inverse relationship between enhancer affinity and Ubx concentration required for transcriptional activation. The Ubx cofactor, Homothorax (Hth), was co-enriched with Ubx near enhancers that require Hth, even though Ubx and Hth did not co-localize throughout the nucleus. Thus, microenvironments of high local transcription factor and cofactor concentrations could help low-affinity sites overcome their kinetic inefficiency. Mechanisms that generate these microenvironments could be a general feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.},

Activation of the HSN transcriptome is directly orchestrated by a collective of six TFs. Binding site clusters for this TF collective form a regulatory signature that is sufficient for de novo identification of HSN neuron functional enhancers. Among C. elegans neurons, the HSN transcriptome most closely resembles that of mouse serotonergic neurons.

We decoded the regulatory information that controls the expression of five enzymes and transporters that define the terminal identity of all eight dopaminergic neurons in the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite. We show that the tightly coordinated, robust expression of these dopaminergic enzymes and transporters ("dopamine pathway") is ensured through a combinatorial cis-regulatory signature that is shared by all dopamine pathway genes. This signature is composed of an Ets domain-binding site, recognized by the previously described AST-1 Ets domain factor, and two distinct types of homeodomain-binding sites that act in a partially redundant manner. Through genetic screens, we identified the sole C. elegans Distalless/Dlx ortholog, ceh-43, as a factor that acts through one of the homeodomain sites to control both induction and maintenance of terminal dopaminergic fate. The second type of homeodomain site is a Pbx-type site, which is recognized in a partially redundant and neuron subtype-specific manner by two Pbx factors, ceh-20 and ceh-40, revealing novel roles of Pbx factors in the context of terminal neuron differentiation. Taken together, we revealed a specific regulatory signature and cognate, terminal selector-type transcription factors that define the entire dopaminergic nervous system of an animal. Dopaminergic neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb express a similar combinatorial transcription factor collective of Ets/Dlx/Pbx factors, suggesting deep phylogenetic conservation of dopaminergic regulatory programs.},

This specification of identity is thought to be directed by differential Hox gene action, based on differential spatiotemporal expression patterns, protein sequence differences, interactions with co-factors and regulation of specific downstream genes. During embryonic development of the Drosophila brain, the Hox gene labial is required for the regionalized specification of the tritocerebral neuromere; in the absence of labial, the cells in this brain region do not acquire a neuronal identity and major axonal pathfinding deficits result. We have used genetic rescue experiments to investigate the functional equivalence of the  Drosophila Hox gene products in the specification of the tritocerebral neuromere. Using the Gal4-UAS system, we first demonstrate that the labial mutant brain phenotype can be rescued by targeted expression of the Labial protein under the control of CNS-specific labial regulatory elements. We then show that under the control of these CNS-specific regulatory elements, all other Drosophila Hox gene  products, except Abdominal-B, are able to efficiently replace Labial in the specification of the tritocerebral neuromere. We also observe a correlation between the rescue efficiency of the Hox proteins and the chromosomal arrangement of their encoding loci. Our results indicate that, despite considerably diverged  sequences, most Hox proteins are functionally equivalent in their ability to replace Labial in the specification of neuronal identity. This suggests that in embryonic brain development, differences in Hox gene action rely mainly on cis-acting regulatory elements and not on Hox protein specificity.},

Mutations in homeotic (Hox) genes have long been suggested as potential causes of morphological evolution, and there is abundant evidence that some changes in Hox expression patterns correlate with transitions in animal axial pattern. A major morphological transition in metazoans occurred about 400 million years ago, when  six-legged insects diverged from crustacean-like arthropod ancestors with multiple limbs. In Drosophila melanogaster and other insects, the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and abdominal A (AbdA, also abd-A) Hox proteins are expressed largely in the abdominal segments, where they can suppress thoracic leg development during embryogenesis. In a branchiopod crustacean, Ubx/AbdA proteins are expressed in both thorax and abdomen, including the limb primordia, but do not repress limbs.  Previous studies led us to propose that gain and loss of transcriptional activation and repression functions in Hox proteins was a plausible mechanism to  diversify morphology during animal evolution.

	abstract = {The homeodomain proteins, HoxA10 and Pbx1a, interact with negative cis elements to repress gene transcription in undifferentiated myeloid cells. The CYBB and NCF2 genes, which encode the gp91PHOX and p67PHOX proteins, are two such HoxA10-Pbx1a target genes. In previous studies, we found that HoxA10-Pbx1a represses transcription of these genes by two mechanisms: competition for DNA binding with transcriptional activators and endogenous repression activity. In these studies, we identify a novel molecular mechanism of endogenous transcriptional repression by HoxA10-Pbx1a. Endogenous repression activity of other Hox-Pbx1a complexes requires recruitment of transcriptional co-repressor proteins by Pbx1a. In contrast, our investigations have determined that HoxA10 has Pbx1a-independent endogenous repression activity. We find that this transcriptional repression activity is abrogated by histone deacetylase inhibitors, suggesting involvement of co-repressor proteins. Consistent with this, we identify HoxA10 amino acids 224-249 as a Pbx1-independent repression domain, which interacts with histone deacetylase 2. We have determined that this  HoxA10 domain is not conserved with other Abd Hox proteins, although homology exists with other transcription factors and co-repressors. Understanding the roles different Hox proteins play in myeloid differentiation is a challenging problem. Our results suggest that insight into this problem can be obtained from  biochemical characterization of the various molecular mechanisms of Hox protein function.},

	abstract = {The Drosophila body plan is composed of a linear array of cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal segments along the anterior posterior axis. The number and positions of individual segments are established by a transcriptional network comprised of maternal effect, gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity genes. The sloppy-paired (slp) locus contains two genes (slp1 and slp2) that are expressed in overlapping  striped patterns in the presumptive thorax and abdomen. Previous studies suggest  that these genes function at the pair-rule and segment polarity levels to establish the spacing and polarity of thoracic and abdominal segments. One of these genes (slp1) is also expressed in a broad anterior domain that appears before the striped patterns. There are severe cephalic defects in slp1 mutants, including the complete loss of the mandibular segment, but the molecular roles played by Slp1 in anterior patterning are not clear. Here, we present evidence that the anterior Slp1 domain acts as a gradient to differentially repress the anteriormost stripes of several different pair-rule genes. This repressive gradient contributes to the precise spatial arrangement of anterior pair-rule stripe borders required for expression of the first engrailed stripe and the formation of the mandibular segment. These results suggest that Slp1 functions as a gap gene-like repressor, in addition to its roles at the pair-rule and segment  polarity levels of the hierarchy. The Slp1 protein contains a protein motif (EH1) which mediates binding to the transcriptional corepressor Groucho (Gro). We show  that this domain is required for Slp1-mediated repression in vivo.},

Upon addition of Meis3, Hoxb1b mimics the more severe Hoxb1a phenotype, indicating that Hoxb1b requires higher Meis levels than Hoxb1a.

Three conserved repeats (R1, R2, and R3) in the enhancer have been described as Pbx-Hoxb1 (PH) binding sites, and one Pbx-Meinox (PM) binding site has also been characterized. We have investigated the importance and relative roles of PH and PM binding sites with respect to protein interactions and in vivo regulatory activity. We have identified a new PM site (PM2) and found that it cooperates with the R3 PH site to form ternary Prep1-Pbx1-Hoxb1 complexes. In vivo, the combination of the R3 and PM2 sites is sufficient to mediate transgenic reporter activity in the developing chick hindbrain. In both chicken and mouse transgenic embryos, mutations of the PM1 and PM2 sites reveal that they cooperate to modulate in vivo regulatory activity of the Hoxb1 enhancer. Furthermore, we have shown that the R2 motif functions as a strong PM site, with a high binding affinity for Prep1-Pbx1 dimers, and renamed this site R2/PM3. In vitro R2/PM3, when combined with the PM1 and R3 motifs, inhibits ternary complex formation mediated by these elements and in vivo reduces and restricts reporter expression  in transgenic embryos. These inhibitory effects appear to be a consequence of the high PM binding activity of the R2/PM3 site. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the activity of the Hoxb1 autoregulatory enhancer depends upon multiple Prep1-Pbx1 (PM1, PM2, and PM3) and Pbx1-Hoxb1 (R1 and R3) binding sites  that cooperate to modulate and spatially restrict the expression of Hoxb1 in r4 rhombomere.},

This suggests that Ubx cooperatively assembles a multi-protein repression complex on Distal-less regulatory DNA with the YPWM motif as a key protein-protein interface in this complex. Our deletion mutants also provide evidence for a transcriptional activation domain in the N-terminal 19 amino acids of Ubx. This proposed activation domain contains a variant of the SSYF motif that is found at the N termini of many Hox proteins, and is conserved in the activation domain of another Hox protein, Sex combs reduced.

The incorporation of this modified histone into nucleosomal arrays inhibits the formation of compact 30-nanometer-like fibers and impedes the ability of chromatin to form cross-fiber interactions. H4-K16Ac also inhibits the ability of the adenosine triphosphate-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling enzyme ACF to mobilize a mononucleosome, indicating that this single histone modification modulates both higher order chromatin structure and functional interactions between a nonhistone protein and the chromatin fiber.},

	abstract = {Deuterostome animals exhibit widely divergent body plans. Echinoderms have either radial or bilateral symmetry, hemichordates include bilateral enteropneust worms  and colonial pterobranchs, and chordates possess a defined dorsal-ventral axis imposed on their anterior-posterior axis. Tunicates are chordates only as larvae, following metamorphosis the adults acquire a body plan unique for the deuterostomes. This paper examines larval and adult body plans in the deuterostomes and discusses two distinct ways of evolving divergent body plans. First, echinoderms and hemichordates have similar feeding larvae, but build a new adult body within or around their larvae. In hemichordates and many direct-developing echinoderms, the adult is built onto the larva, with the larval axes becoming the adult axes and the larval mouth becoming the adult mouth. In contrast, indirect-developing echinoderms undergo radical metamorphosis where adult axes are not the same as larval axes. A second way of evolving a divergent  body plan is to become colonial, as seen in hemichordates and tunicates. Early embryonic development and gastrulation are similar in all deuterostomes, but, in  chordates, the anterior-posterior axis is established at right angles to the animal-vegetal axis, in contrast to hemichordates and indirect-developing echinoderms. Hox gene sequences and anterior-posterior expression patterns illuminate deuterostome phylogenetic relationships and the evolution of unique adult body plans within monophyletic groups. Many genes that are considered vertebrate 'mesodermal' genes, such as nodal and brachyury T, are likely to ancestrally have been involved in the formation of the mouth and anus, and later  were evolutionarily co-opted into mesoderm during vertebrate development.},

These genes are transcribed after the promyelocyte stage of differentiation, and transcription continues until cell death. In undifferentiated myeloid cells, homologous cis-elements in the CYBB and NCF2 genes are repressed by the homeodomain transcription factor HoxA10. During cytokine-induced myelopoiesis, tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 decreases binding affinity for the CYBB and NCF2 cis-elements. This abrogates HoxA10-induced transcriptional repression as differentiation proceeds. Therefore, mechanisms involved in differentiation stage-specific HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation are of interest because HoxA10 phosphorylation modulates myeloid-specific gene transcription. In this study, we found that HoxA10 is a substrate for SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in undifferentiated myeloid cells. In contrast, HoxA10 is a substrate for a constitutively active mutant form of SHP2 in both undifferentiated and differentiating myeloid cells. Expression of such SHP2 mutants results in persistent HoxA10 repression of CYBB and NCF2 transcription during myelopoiesis. Both HoxA10 overexpression and activating SHP2 mutations have been described in human myeloid malignancies. Therefore, our results suggest that these mutations could cooperate, leading to decreased myeloid-specific gene transcription and functional differentiation block in myeloid cells with both defects.},

	abstract = {Functional diversification of body parts is dependent on the formation of specialized structures along the various body axes. In animals, region-specific morphogenesis along the anteroposterior axis is controlled by a group of conserved transcription factors encoded by the Hox genes. Although it has long been assumed that Hox proteins carry out their function by regulating distinct sets of downstream genes, only a small number of such genes have been found, with very few having direct roles in controlling cellular behavior. We have quantitatively identified hundreds of Hox downstream genes in Drosophila by microarray analysis, and validated many of them by in situ hybridizations on loss- and gain-of-function mutants. One important finding is that Hox proteins, despite their similar DNA-binding properties in vitro, have highly specific effects on the transcriptome in vivo, because expression of many downstream genes respond primarily to a single Hox protein. In addition, a large fraction of downstream genes encodes realizator functions, which directly affect morphogenetic processes, such as orientation and rate of cell divisions, cell-cell adhesion and communication, cell shape and migration, or cell death. Focusing on these realizators, we provide a framework for the morphogenesis of the maxillary segment. As the genomic organization of Hox genes and the interaction of Hox proteins with specific co-factors are conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, and similar classes of downstream genes are regulated by Hox proteins across the metazoan phylogeny, our findings represent a first step toward a mechanistic understanding of morphological diversification within a species as well as between species.},

Here we show that HOXA10 contributes to osteogenic lineage determination through activation of Runx2 and directly regulates osteoblastic phenotypic genes. In response to bone morphogenic protein BMP2, Hoxa10 is rapidly induced and functions to activate the Runx2 transcription factor essential for bone formation. A functional element with the Hox core motif was characterized for the bone-related Runx2 P1 promoter. HOXA10 also activates other osteogenic genes, including the alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein genes, and temporally associates with these target gene promoters during stages of osteoblast differentiation prior to the recruitment of RUNX2. Exogenous expression and small interfering RNA knockdown studies establish that HOXA10 mediates chromatin hyperacetylation and trimethyl histone K4 (H3K4) methylation of these genes, correlating to active transcription. HOXA10 therefore contributes to early expression of osteogenic genes through chromatin remodeling. Importantly, HOXA10 can induce osteoblast genes in Runx2 null cells, providing evidence for a direct role in mediating osteoblast differentiation independent of RUNX2. We propose that HOXA10 activates RUNX2 in mesenchymal cells, contributing  to the onset of osteogenesis, and that HOXA10 subsequently supports bone formation by direct regulation of osteoblast phenotypic genes.},

Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), a positive regulator of Wnt signaling, is present in beta-catenin complexes and activated in Wnt-signaling cells. We show here that CK2 enhances beta-catenin:LEF-1 transactivation in vivo and in vitro and that beta-catenin and CK2 cycle on and off the DNA in an alternating manner with the TLE1 corepressor at Wnt target genes. Interestingly, CK2 phosphorylates hLEF-1 directly and stimulates binding and transactivation of beta-catenin:LEF-1 complexes on chromatin templates in vitro. In vitro, CK2 phosphorylation of hLEF-1 strongly enhances its affinity for beta-catenin and reduces its affinity for TLE1. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS)  identified two CK2 phosphorylation sites (S42, S61) within the amino terminus of  hLEF-1, and mutation of these sites reduced binding to beta-catenin in vitro and  transactivation in vivo. Remarkably, treatment of cells with TBB, a pharmaceutical inhibitor of CK2, blocked the recruitment and cycling of beta-catenin and TLE1 at Wnt target genes in vivo.

In this study we have used sequenced comparisons of the Hoxa2 locus from 12 vertebrate species in combination with detailed regulatory analyses in mouse and chicken embryos to characterize the mechanistic basis for the regulation of Hoxa2 in rhombomere (r)  4. A highly conserved region in the Hoxa2 intron functions as an r4 enhancer. In  vitro binding studies demonstrate that within the conserved region three bipartite Hox/Pbx binding sites (PH1-PH3) in combination with a single binding site for Pbx-Prep/Meis (PM) heterodimers co-operate to regulate enhancer activity in r4. Mutational analysis reveals that these sites are required for activity of  the enhancer, suggesting that the r4 enhancer from Hoxa2 functions in vivo as a Hox-response module in combination with the Hox cofactors, Pbx and Prep/Meis. Furthermore, this r4 enhancer is capable of mediating a response to ectopic HOXB1 expression in the hindbrain. These findings reveal that Hoxa2 is a target gene of Hoxb1 and permit us to develop a gene regulatory network for r4, whereby Hoxa2, along with Hoxb1, Hoxb2 and Hoxa1, is integrated into a series of auto- and cross-regulatory loops between Hox genes. These data highlight the important role played by direct cross-talk between Hox genes in regulating hindbrain patterning.},

Herein, we demonstrate that Hox11 paralogous proteins form  a complex with Pax2 and Eya1 to directly activate expression of Six2 and Gdnf in  the metanephric mesenchyme. We have identified the binding site within the Six2 enhancer necessary for Hox11-Eya1-Pax2-mediated activation and demonstrate that this site is essential for Six2 expression in vivo. Furthermore, genetic interactions between Hox11 and Eya1 are consistent with their participation in the same pathway.

Characterized interactions occur through a single mode, involving a short hexapeptide motif in the Hox protein. This apparent uniqueness in Hox-PBC interaction provides little mechanistic insight in how the same cofactors endow Hox proteins with specific and diverse activities. Here, we identify in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) protein a short motif responsible for an alternative mode of Exd recruitment. Together with previous reports, this finding highlights that the Hox protein Ubx has multiple ways to interact with the Exd cofactor and suggests that flexibility in Hox-PBC contacts contributes to specify and diversify Hox protein function.},

In vivo specificity, however, often depends on extended and unstructured regions that link Hox homeodomains to a DNA-bound cofactor, Extradenticle (Exd). Using a combination of structure determination, computational analysis, and in vitro and  in vivo assays, we show that Hox proteins recognize specific Hox-Exd binding sites via residues located in these extended regions that insert into the minor groove but only when presented with the correct DNA sequence. Our results suggest that these residues, which are conserved in a paralog-specific manner, confer specificity by recognizing a sequence-dependent DNA structure instead of directly reading a specific DNA sequence.},

In our study, we investigated the importance of the Antennapedia (Antp) YPWM motif for homeotic transformations in adult Drosophila. By ectopic overexpression, the head structures of the fly can be transformed into structures of the second thoracic segment, such as antenna into second leg, head capsule into thorax (notum) and eye into wing. We found that the YPWM motif is absolutely required for the eye-to-wing transformation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to identify a novel ANTP-interacting protein, Bric-a-brac interacting protein 2 (BIP2), that specifically interacts with the YPWM motif of ANTP in vitro, as well as in vivo, transforming eye to wing tissue. BIP2 is a TATA-binding protein associated factor (also known as dTAFII3) that links ANTP to the basal transcriptional machinery.},

To explore this possibility, we constructed and tested the appendage repression function of  chimeric proteins with insertions of different CK2 consensus sites or phosphomimetics of CK2 sites in C-terminal regions of Drosophila melanogaster UBX.

Sustained HoxA10 expression during differentiation has been described in poor prognosis human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this, engineered overexpression of HoxA10 in murine bone marrow induces a myeloproliferative disorder that progresses to AML over time. This murine model suggests that HoxA10 overexpression is sufficient for myeloproliferation but that differentiation block, and therefore AML, requires acquisition of additional mutations. In myeloid progenitor cells, HoxA10 represses transcription of genes that encode phagocyte effector proteins such as gp91PHOX and p67PHOX. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 during myelopoiesis decreases binding to these target genes. In immature myeloid cells, HoxA10 also activates transcription of the DUSP4 gene that encodes Mkp2, an anti-apoptotic protein. HoxA10 binding to the DUSP4 promoter decreases during myelopoiesis. Therefore, both myeloid-specific gene repression and DUSP4 activation by HoxA10 decrease during myelopoiesis. This results in phenotypic differentiation and facilitates apoptosis as differentiation proceeds. HoxA10 is de-phosphorylated by SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in myeloid progenitors. This mechanism maintains HoxA10 in a nonphosphorylated state in immature, but not differentiating, myeloid cells. Constitutively active SHP2 mutants have been described in human AML, which dephosphorylate HoxA10 throughout myelopoiesis. In this study, we hypothesize that constitutive SHP2 activation synergizes with HoxA10 overexpression to accelerate progression to AML. Because both HoxA10 overexpression and constitutive SHP2 activation are found in poor prognosis human AML, these studies contribute to understanding biochemical aspects of disease progression in myeloid malignancy.},

The premise of this review is that an understanding of gene regulation-by any transcription factor-requires the dissection of the cis-regulatory elements that they act upon. With this goal in mind, we review the concepts and ideas regarding gene regulation by Hox proteins  and apply them to a curated list of directly regulated Hox cis-regulatory elements that have been validated in the literature. Our analysis of the Hox-binding sites within these elements suggests several emerging generalizations. We distinguish between Hox cofactors, proteins that bind DNA cooperatively with Hox proteins and thereby help with DNA-binding site selection, and Hox collaborators, proteins that bind in parallel to Hox-targeted cis-regulatory elements and dictate the sign and strength of gene regulation. Finally, we summarize insights that come from examining five X-ray crystal structures of Hox-cofactor-DNA complexes. Together, these analyses reveal an enormous amount of flexibility into how Hox proteins function to regulate gene expression, perhaps providing an explanation for why these factors have been central players in the evolution of morphological diversity in the animal kingdom.},

Upon transplantation these  lines induced myeloproliferation and acute myeloid leukemia in recipient animals. Kinetic studies with inducible HOX derivatives demonstrated that anterior HOXA genes autonomously contributed to cellular transformation. This function was not  mediated by endogenous Hoxa9, which was persistently expressed in cells transformed by anterior HOX genes.

Similarly, developing Artemia epidermal cells showed expression of abd-A transcripts without accumulation of ABD-A protein. This finding in Artemia reveals a new variation in Hox gene function that is associated with morphological evolution. In this case, a HOX protein expression pattern is completely absent during early development, although the HOX protein is expressed at later stages in the central nervous system in a "homeotic-like" pattern. The combination of an absence of ABD-A protein expression in the Artemia limb primordia and the weak repressive function of Artemia UBX protein on the limb-promoting gene Dll are likely to be two reasons why homonomous limbs develop throughout the entire Artemia trunk.},

Here we have established that Pbx1 negatively regulates Hoxa10-mediated gene transcription in mesenchymal cells and identified components of a Pbx1 complex associated with genes in osteoblasts. Expression of Pbx1 impaired osteogenic commitment of C3H10T1/2 multipotent cells and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. Conversely, targeted depletion of Pbx1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) increased expression of osteoblast-related genes. Studies using wild-type and mutated osteocalcin and Bsp promoters revealed that Pbx1 acts through a Pbx-binding site that is required to attenuate gene activation by Hoxa10. Chromatin-associated Pbx1 and Hoxa10 were present at osteoblast-related gene promoters preceding gene expression, but only Hoxa10 was associated with these promoters during transcription. Our results show that Pbx1 is associated with histone deacetylases normally linked with chromatin inactivation. Loss of Pbx1 from osteoblast promoters in differentiated osteoblasts was associated with  increased histone acetylation and CBP/p300 recruitment, as well as decreased H3K9 methylation. We propose that Pbx1 plays a central role in attenuating the ability of Hoxa10 to activate osteoblast-related genes in order to establish temporal regulation of gene expression during osteogenesis.},

To achieve functional specificity, Hox proteins associate with PBC class proteins, Pre-B cell leukemia homeobox (Pbx) in vertebrates, and Extradenticle (Exd) in Drosophila, and were thought to use a unique hexapeptide-dependent generic mode of interaction. Recent findings, however, revealed the existence of an alternative, UbdA-dependent paralog-specific interaction mode providing diversity in Hox-PBC interactions. In this study, we investigated the basis for the selection of one of these two Hox-PBC interaction modes. Using naturally occurring variations and mutations in  the Drosophila Ultrabithorax protein, we found that the linker region, a short domain separating the hexapeptide from the homeodomain, promotes an interaction mediated by the UbdA domain in a context-dependent manner. While using a UbdA-dependent interaction for the repression of the limb-promoting gene Distalless, interaction with Exd during segment-identity specification still relies on the hexapeptide motif. We further show that distinctly assembled Hox-PBC complexes display subtle but distinct repressive activities. These findings identify Hox-PBC interaction as a template for subtle regulation of Hox  protein activity that may have played a major role in the diversification of Hox  protein function in development and evolution.},

Although they have been shown to regulate a wide variety  of downstream processes, direct transcriptional targets have been difficult to identify and this has been a major obstacle to our understanding of Hox gene function. We report the identification of genome-wide binding sites for the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) using a YFP-tagged Drosophila protein-trap line together with chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis. We identify  1,147 genes bound by Ubx at high confidence in chromatin from the haltere imaginal disc, a prominent site of Ubx function where it specifies haltere versus wing development. The functional relevance of these genes is supported by their overlap with genes differentially expressed between wing and haltere imaginal discs. The Ubx-bound gene set is highly enriched in genes involved in developmental processes and contains both high-level regulators as well as genes  involved in more basic cellular functions. Several signalling pathways are highly enriched in the Ubx target gene set and our analysis supports the view that Hox genes regulate many levels of developmental pathways and have targets distributed throughout the gene network. We also performed genome-wide analysis of the binding sites for the Hox cofactor Homothorax (Hth), revealing a striking similarity with the Ubx binding profile. We suggest that these binding profiles may be strongly influenced by chromatin accessibility and provide evidence of a link between Ubx/Hth binding and chromatin state at genes regulated by Polycomb silencing. Overall, we define a set of direct Ubx targets in the haltere imaginal disc and suggest that chromatin accessibility has important implications for Hox  target selection and for transcription factor binding in general.},

Applying this method to all eight Drosophila Hox proteins, we show that they obtain novel recognition properties when they bind DNA with the dimeric cofactor Extradenticle-Homothorax (Exd). Exd-Hox specificities group into three main classes that obey Hox gene collinearity rules and DNA structure predictions suggest that anterior and posterior Hox proteins prefer DNA sequences with distinct minor groove topographies.

Abdominal-A (AbdA) is more complex, using multiple conserved motifs in a context-dependent manner. Lastly, Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is the most flexible, in that it uses multiple conserved motifs that function in parallel to regulate target genes in vivo.

Our previous work showed that two  orthologous members of this family, Hoxd10 and Hoxd11, exert opposing effects on  motoneuron development in the lumbosacral (LS) spinal cord of the embryonic chick: Hoxd10 promotes the development of lateral motoneuron subtypes that project to dorsal limb muscles, while Hoxd11 represses the development of lateral subtypes in favor of medial subtypes that innervate ventral limb muscles and axial muscles. The striking degree of homology between the DNA-binding homeodomains of Hoxd10 and Hoxd11 suggested that non-homeodomain regions mediate  their divergent effects. In the present study, we investigate the relative contributions of homeodomain and non-homeodomain regions of Hoxd10 and Hoxd11 to  motoneuron specification. RESULTS: Using in ovo electroporation to express chimeric and mutant constructs in LS motoneurons, we find that both the homeodomain and non-homeodomain regions of Hoxd10 are necessary to specify lateral motoneurons. In contrast, non-homeodomain regions of Hoxd11 are sufficient to repress lateral motoneuron fates in favor of medial fates. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data demonstrate that even closely related Hox orthologues rely on distinct combinations of homeodomain-dependent and -independent mechanisms to specify motoneuron identity.},

We show that the local chromatin conformation at Dll depends on the cell type: in cells that express Dll, the 5' regulatory region is in close proximity to the Dll promoter. In Dll-nonexpressing cells this DNA is in a more extended configuration. In addition, transcriptional activators and repressors are bound to Dll regulatory DNA in a cell type-specific manner.

In this review, we summarize the current Hox inventory among deuterostomes, not only in the well-known teleosts and tetrapods, but also in the earlier vertebrate and invertebrate groups. We draw an updated picture of the ancestral repertoires of the different lineages, a sort of "genome Hox bar-code" for most clades. This scenario allows us to infer differential gene or cluster losses and gains that occurred during deuterostome evolution, which might be causally linked to the morphological changes that led to these widely diverse animal taxa.

	abstract = {Segmental identity along the anteroposterior axis of bilateral animals is specified by Hox genes. These genes encode transcription factors, harboring the conserved homeodomain and, generally, a YPWM motif, which binds Hox cofactors and increases Hox transcriptional specificity in vivo. Here we derive synthetic Drosophila Antennapedia genes, consisting only of the YPWM motif and homeodomain, and investigate their functional role throughout development. Synthetic peptides  and full-length Antennapedia proteins cause head-to-thorax transformations in the embryo, as well as antenna-to-tarsus and eye-to-wing transformations in the adult, thus converting the entire head to a mesothorax. This conversion is achieved by repression of genes required for head and antennal development and ectopic activation of genes promoting thoracic and tarsal fates, respectively. Synthetic Antennapedia peptides bind DNA specifically and interact with Extradenticle and Bric-a-brac interacting protein 2 cofactors in vitro and ex vivo. Substitution of the YPWM motif by alanines abolishes Antennapedia homeotic  function, whereas substitution of YPWM by the WRPW repressor motif, which binds the transcriptional corepressor Groucho, allows all proteins to act as repressors only. Finally, naturally occurring variations in the size of the linker between the homeodomain and YPWM motif enhance Antennapedia repressive or activating efficiency, emphasizing the importance of linker size, rather than sequence, for  specificity. Our results clearly show that synthetic Antennapedia genes are functional in vivo and therefore provide powerful tools for synthetic biology. Moreover, the YPWM motif is necessary--whereas the entire N terminus of the protein is dispensable--for Antennapedia homeotic function, indicating its dual role in transcriptional activation and repression by recruiting either coactivators or corepressors.},

The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality.

Here, we identified the binding sites for Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 on a genome-wide level and profiled their associated epigenetic modifications and transcriptional targets. Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 cobind at hundreds of highly evolutionarily conserved sites, most of which are distant from transcription start sites. These sites show high levels of histone H3K4 monomethylation and CBP/P300 binding characteristic of enhancers. Furthermore, a subset of these sites shows enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. Many Hoxa9 and Meis1 binding sites are also bound by PU.1 and other lineage-restricted transcription factors previously implicated in establishment of myeloid enhancers. Conditional Hoxa9 activation is associated with CBP/P300 recruitment, histone acetylation, and transcriptional activation of a network of proto-oncogenes, including Erg, Flt3, Lmo2, Myb, and Sox4. Collectively, this work suggests that Hoxa9 regulates transcription by interacting with enhancers of genes important for hematopoiesis and leukemia.},

Upon binding to PARP-1, HOXB7 undergoes poly(ADP-ribosyl)altion resulting in a reduction of its transcriptional activity. Since aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues are acceptors of the ADP ribose moiety transferred by PARP-1, deletion of the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal Glu-rich tail of HOXB7 dramatically attenuates ADP-ribosylation of HOXB7 by PARP-1. Further, a mutant of HOXB7 without the Glu-rich tail loses the ability to be negatively regulated by PARP-1  and becomes transcriptionally more active in luciferase reporter assays.

Sequence divergence of paralogous proteins accounts for functional specialization, promoting axial morphological diversification in bilaterian animals. Yet functionally specialized paralogous Hox proteins also continue performing ancient common functions. In this study, we investigate how highly divergent Hox proteins perform an identical function. This was achieved by comparing in Drosophila the mode of limb suppression by the central (Ultrabithorax and AbdominalA) and posterior class (AbdominalB) Hox proteins. Results highlight that Hox-mediated limb suppression relies on distinct modes of DNA binding and a distinct use of TALE cofactors. Control of common functions by divergent Hox proteins, at least in the case studied, relies on evolving novel molecular properties. Thus, changes in protein sequences not only  provide the driving force for functional specialization of Hox paralogue proteins, but also provide means to perform common ancient functions in distinct  ways.},

Genetic analyses initially demonstrated that interfering with Hox genes has profound effects on the specification of cell identity, suggesting that Hox proteins regulate very specific sets of target genes. However, subsequent biochemical analyses revealed that Hox proteins bind DNA with relatively low affinity and specificity. Furthermore, it became clear that a given Hox protein could activate or repress transcription, depending on the context. A resolution to these paradoxes presented itself with the discovery  that Hox proteins do not function in isolation, but interact with other factors in complexes. The first such "cofactors" were members of the Extradenticle/Pbx and Homothorax/Meis/Prep families. However, the list of Hox-interacting proteins  has continued to grow, suggesting that Hox complexes contain many more components than initially thought. Additionally, the activities of the various components and the exact mechanisms whereby they modulate the activity of the complex remain puzzling. Here, we review the various proteins known to participate in Hox complexes and discuss their likely functions. We also consider that Hox complexes of different compositions may have different activities and discuss mechanisms whereby Hox complexes may be switched between active and inactive states.},

Here, we use genome-wide open chromatin profiling to show that among the Drosophila appendages, the same DNA regulatory modules are accessible throughout the genome at a given stage of development, except at the loci encoding the master regulators themselves. In addition, open chromatin profiles change over developmental time, and these changes are coordinated between different appendages.

However, approximately one third of protein interactions are estimated to involve intrinsically disordered regions of proteins. The dynamic nature of disordered regions before and, in some cases, after binding calls into question the role of  partner topology in forming protein interactions. To understand how intrinsically disordered proteins identify the correct interacting partner proteins, we evaluated interactions formed by the Drosophila melanogaster Hox transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx), which contains both structured and disordered regions. Ubx binding proteins are enriched in specific folds: 23 of its 39 partners include one of 7 folds, out of the 1195 folds recognized by SCOP. For the proteins harboring the two most populated folds, DNA-RNA binding 3-helical bundles and alpha-alpha superhelices, the regions of the partner proteins that exhibit these preferred folds are sufficient for Ubx binding. Three disorder-containing regions in Ubx are required to bind these partners. These regions are either alternatively spliced or multiply phosphorylated, providing a  mechanism for cellular processes to regulate Ubx-partner interactions. Indeed, partner topology correlates with the ability of individual partner proteins to bind Ubx spliceoforms. Partners bind different disordered regions within Ubx to varying extents, creating the potential for competition between partners and cooperative binding by partners. The ability of partners to bind regions of Ubx that activate transcription and regulate DNA binding provides a mechanism for partners to modulate transcription regulation by Ubx, and suggests that one role  of disorder in Ubx is to coordinate multiple molecular functions in response to tissue-specific cues.},

We mapped binding of Meis, Pbx, and Hoxa2 in the branchial arches, a series of segments in the developing vertebrate head. Meis occupancy is largely similar in Hox-positive and -negative arches. Hoxa2, which specifies second arch  (IIBA) identity, recognizes a subset of Meis prebound sites that contain Hox motifs. Importantly, at these sites Meis binding is strongly increased. This enhanced Meis binding coincides with active enhancers, which are linked to genes  highly expressed in the IIBA and regulated by Hoxa2.

This is well illustrated by the Hox family of transcription factors as their limited in vitro DNA-binding specificity contrasts with their clear in vivo functional specificity. RESULTS: We generated genome-wide binding profiles for three Hox proteins, Ubx, Abd-A and Abd-B, following transient expression in Drosophila Kc167 cells, revealing clear target specificity and a striking influence of chromatin accessibility. In the absence of the TALE class homeodomain cofactors Exd and Hth, Ubx and Abd-A bind at a very similar set of target sites in accessible chromatin, whereas Abd-B binds at an additional specific set of targets. Provision of Hox cofactors Exd and Hth considerably modifies the Ubx genome-wide binding profile enabling Ubx to bind at an additional novel set of targets. Both the Abd-B specific targets and the cofactor-dependent Ubx targets are in chromatin that is relatively DNase1 inaccessible prior to the expression of Hox proteins/Hox cofactors. CONCLUSIONS:  Our experiments demonstrate a strong role for chromatin accessibility in Hox protein binding and suggest that Hox protein competition with nucleosomes has a major role in Hox protein target specificity in vivo.},

About 7100 of these lines yielded at least a quarter of unhatched eggs and were then scored for embryonic phenotypes. Through microscopic examination of unhatched eggs 1772 lines corresponding to 24\% of all lethal hits were classified as embryonic lethal. In 198 lines (2.7\% of all lethal hits), mutant embryos showed distinct abnormalities of the larval cuticle. These embryonic visible mutants define 45 loci by complementation analysis. For 32 loci, more than one mutant allele was recovered, with an average of 5.8 alleles per locus. Complementation of all other mutants was shown by 13 mutants. The genes were localized on the genetic map by recombination analysis, as well as cytologically  by complementation analysis with deficiencies. They appear to be randomly distributed along the chromosome. Allele frequencies and comparisons with deficiency phenotypes indicate that the 45 loci represent most, if not all, zygotic loci on the third chromosome, where lack of function recognizably affects the morphology of the larval cuticle.},

Examining a Hoxb1b:TALE complex that regulates zebrafish hoxb1a transcription, we find maternally deposited TALE proteins at the hoxb1a promoter  already during blastula stages. These TALE factors recruit histone-modifying enzymes to promote an active chromatin profile at the hoxb1a promoter and also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and P-TEFb. However, in the presence of TALE factors, RNAPII remains phosphorylated on serine 5 and hoxb1a transcription is inefficient. By gastrula stages, Hoxb1b binds together with TALE factors to the hoxb1a promoter. This triggers P-TEFb-mediated transitioning of RNAPII to the serine 2-phosphorylated form and efficient hoxb1a transcription. We conclude that TALE factors access promoters during early embryogenesis to poise them for activation but that Hox proteins are required to trigger efficient transcription.},

By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans.

	abstract = {Homeobox A9 (HOXA9) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a key role in hematopoietic stem cell expansion and is commonly deregulated in human acute leukemias. A variety of upstream genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lead to overexpression of HOXA9, almost always in association with overexpression of its cofactor meis homeobox 1 (MEIS1) . A wide range of data suggests that HOXA9 and MEIS1 play a synergistic causative role in AML, although  the molecular mechanisms leading to transformation by HOXA9 and MEIS1 remain elusive. In this study, we identify CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) as a critical collaborator required for Hoxa9/Meis1-mediated leukemogenesis. We show that C/EBPalpha is required for the proliferation of Hoxa9/Meis1-transformed cells in culture and that loss of C/EBPalpha greatly improves survival in both primary and secondary murine models of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemia. Over 50\% of Hoxa9 genome-wide binding sites are cobound by C/EBPalpha, which coregulates a number of downstream target genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we show that Hoxa9 represses the locus of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cdkn2a/b in concert with C/EBPalpha to overcome a block in G1 cell cycle progression. Together, our results suggest a previously unidentified role for C/EBPalpha in maintaining the proliferation required for Hoxa9/Meis1-mediated leukemogenesis.},

Complexes made with these mutants lose the preference to bind sequences with specific DNA shape features. Introducing shape-recognizing residues from one Hox  protein to another swapped binding specificities in vitro and gene regulation in  vivo. Statistical machine learning revealed that the accuracy of binding specificity predictions improves by adding shape features to a model that only depends on sequence, and feature selection identified shape features important for recognition.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determining the function of regulatory elements is fundamental for our understanding of development, disease and evolution. However, the sequence features that mediate these functions are often unclear and the prediction of tissue-specific expression patterns from sequence alone is non-trivial. Previous  functional studies have demonstrated a link between PBX-HOX and MEIS/PREP binding interactions and hindbrain enhancer activity, but the defining grammar of these sites, if any exists, has remained elusive. RESULTS: Here, we identify a shared sequence signature (syntax) within a heterogeneous set of conserved vertebrate hindbrain enhancers composed of spatially co-occurring PBX-HOX and MEIS/PREP transcription factor binding motifs. We use this syntax to accurately predict hindbrain enhancers in 89\% of cases (67/75 predicted elements) from a set of conserved non-coding elements (CNEs). Furthermore, mutagenesis of the sites abolishes activity or generates ectopic expression, demonstrating their requirement for segmentally restricted enhancer activity in the hindbrain. We refine and use our syntax to predict over 3,000 hindbrain enhancers across the human genome. These sequences tend to be located near developmental transcription factors and are enriched in known hindbrain activating elements, demonstrating the predictive power of this simple model. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the theory that hundreds of CNEs, and perhaps thousands of regions across the human genome, function to coordinate gene expression in the developing hindbrain. We speculate that deeply conserved sequences of this kind contributed to the co-option of new genes into the hindbrain gene regulatory network during early vertebrate evolution by linking patterns of hox expression to downstream genes involved in segmentation and patterning, and evolutionarily newer instances may have continued to contribute to lineage-specific elaboration of the hindbrain.},

In order to more fully define the developmental roles of Hox genes it is necessary to remove multiple combinations of paralogous and flanking genes. In addition, the downstream molecular pathways regulated by Hox genes during limb development remain incompletely delineated. RESULTS: In this report we examine limb development in mice with frameshift mutations in six Hox genes, Hoxa9,10,11  and Hoxd9,10,11. The mice were made with a novel recombineering method that allows the simultaneous targeting of frameshift mutations into multiple flanking  genes. The Hoxa9,10,11 (-/-) /Hoxd9,10,11 (-/-) mutant mice show a reduced ulna and radius that is more severe than seen in Hoxa11 (-/-)/Hoxd11 (-/-) mice, indicating a minor role for the flanking Hox9,10 genes in zeugopod development, as well as their primary function in stylopod development. The mutant mice also show severe reduction of Shh expression in the zone of polarizing activity, and decreased Fgf8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge, thereby better defining the roles of these specific Hox genes in the regulation of critical signaling centers during limb development. Importantly, we also used laser capture microdissection coupled with RNA-Seq to characterize the gene expression programs in wild type and mutant limbs.

Although shifts in Hox  gene expression domains have been postulated to play a role in generating this limb diversity, little functional data have been provided to understand the precise roles of Hox genes during crustacean development. We used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis and RNAi knockdown to decipher the function of the six Hox genes expressed in the developing mouth and trunk of the amphipod  Parhyale hawaiensis. These experimentally manipulated animals display specific and striking homeotic transformations. We found that abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) are required for proper posterior patterning, with knockout of Abd-B resulting in an animal with thoracic type legs along what would have been an abdomen, and abd-A disruption generating a simplified body plan characterized by a loss of specialization in both abdominal and thoracic appendages. In the thorax, Ubx is necessary for gill development and for repression of gnathal fate, and Antp dictates claw morphology. In the mouth, Scr  and Antp confer the part-gnathal, part-thoracic hybrid identity of the maxilliped, and Scr and Dfd prevent antennal identity in posterior head segments. Our results allow us to define the role Hox genes play in specifying each appendage type in Parhyale, including the modular nature by which some appendages are patterned by Hox gene inputs. In addition, we define how changes in Hox gene  expression have generated morphological differences between crustacean species.

We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns.

	abstract = {Motivation: Characterizing the binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) is crucial to the study of gene expression regulation. Recently developed high-throughput experimental methods, including protein binding microarrays (PBM) and high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX), have enabled rapid measurements of the specificities for hundreds of TFs. However, few studies have developed efficient algorithms for estimating binding motifs based on HT-SELEX data. Also the simple method of constructing a position weight matrix (PWM) by comparing the frequency of the preferred sequence with single-nucleotide variants has the risk of generating motifs with higher information content than the true binding specificity.
Results: We developed an algorithm called BEESEM that builds on a comprehensive biophysical model of protein-DNA interactions, which is trained using the expectation maximization method. BEESEM is capable of selecting the optimal motif length and calculating the confidence intervals of estimated parameters. By comparing BEESEM with the published motifs estimated using the same HT-SELEX data, we demonstrate that BEESEM provides significant improvements.We also evaluate several motif discovery algorithms on independent PBM and ChIP-seq data. BEESEM provides significantly better fits to in vitro data, but its performance is similar to some other methods on in vivo data under the criterion of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). This highlights the limitations of the purely rank-based AUROC criterion. Using quantitative binding data to assess models, however, demonstrates that BEESEM improves on prior models.

Recent studies have shown that noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been associated with risk for numerous common diseases through genome-wide association studies frequently lie in cell-type-specific enhancer elements. These enhancer variants probably influence transcriptional output, thereby offering a mechanistic basis to explain their association with risk for many common diseases. This review focuses on the identification and interpretation of disease-susceptibility variants that influence enhancer function. We discuss strategies for prioritizing the study of functional enhancer SNPs over those likely to be benign, review experimental and computational approaches to identifying the gene targets of enhancer variants, and highlight efforts to quantify the impact of enhancer variants on target transcript levels and cellular phenotypes. These studies are beginning to provide insights into the mechanistic basis of many common diseases, as well as into how we might translate this knowledge for improved disease diagnosis, prevention and treatments. Finally, we highlight five major challenges often associated with interpreting enhancer variants, and discuss recent technical advances that may help to surmount these challenges.},

The bicoid (bcd) regulatory gradient triggers the expression of hunchback (hb); these work synergistically to activate the stripe in the anterior half of the embryo, bcd also coordinates the expression of two repressors, giant (gt) and Kruppel (Kr), which define the anterior and posterior borders of the stripe, respectively. Here, we report the findings of extensive cis- and trans- complementation analyses using a series of defective stripe 2 enhancers in transgenic embryos. This study reaches two primary conclusions. First, the strip 2 enhancer is inherently 'sensitized' for repression by gt. We propose that gt specifies the sharp anterior stripe border by blocking two tiers of transcriptional synergy, cooperative binding to DNA and cooperative contact of bound activators with the transcription complex. Second, we find that the synergistic activity of hb and bcd is 'promiscuous'. For example, a maternally expressed Gal4-Sp1 fusion protein can functionally replace hb in the stripe 2 enhancer. This finding challenges previous proposals for dedicated hb and bcd interactions in the segmentation process.},

	abstract = {Positional information in developing embryos is specified by spatial gradients of transcriptional regulators. One of the classic systems for studying this is the activation of the hunchback (hb) gene in early fruit fly (Drosophila) segmentation by the maternally-derived gradient of the Bicoid (Bcd) protein. Gene regulation is subject to intrinsic noise which can produce variable expression. This variability must be constrained in the highly reproducible and coordinated events of development. We identify means by which noise is controlled during gene expression by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on hb promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics. We use a stochastic model of the hb promoter in which the number and strength of Bcd and Hb (self-regulatory) binding sites can be varied. Model parameters are fit to data from WT embryos, the self-regulation mutant hb(14F), and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the hb promoter. We have corroborated model noise predictions experimentally. The results indicate that WT (self-regulatory) Hb output noise is predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations. The constructs and mutant, which lack self-regulation, indicate that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter (and their strengths) also play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to the variation in Bcd binding site number across a number of fly species. This study identifies particular ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise. Insofar as many of these are common features of genes (e.g. multiple regulatory sites, cooperativity, self-feedback), the current results contribute to the general understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The activity of the Bicoid (Bcd) transcription factor is a useful example of how quantitative information contained in a smooth morphogen gradient is transformed into discrete and precise patterns of target gene expression. There are two distinct and important aspects to this process: the "sharpening" of the posterior borders of the expression domains and the "precision" of where the target genes are expressed along the length of the embryo as the syncytial embryo begins to cellularize. Although the sharpening phenomenon was observed over a decade ago, it is still poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here, we show that a Bcd reporter gene containing binding sites only for Bcd is expressed, like natural targets of Bcd, in a precise domain with a sharp boundary. Analysis of embryos expressing deleted forms of Bcd indicates that the sharpness of the Bcd target gene hunchback's expression involves the glutamine-rich and C-terminal activation domains of Bcd. Furthermore, several artificial Gal4-derived transcription factors expressed as gradients in the embryo share Bcd's ability to drive precise target gene expression with sharp boundaries.
CONCLUSION: Thus, contrary to recent reports proposing that the Bcd gradient is not sufficient to establish precise positional information, we show that Bcd drives precise and sharp expression of its target genes through a process that depends exclusively on its ability to activate transcription.},

We observed that increasing concentrations of NF-kappaB are translated into gradual increments in gene transcription. We provide a thermodynamic interpretation of the experimental observations by combining quantitative measurements and a minimal physical model of an NF-kappaB-dependent promoter. We demonstrate that NF-kappaB binds independently to adjacent sites to promote additive RNA Pol II recruitment and graded transcriptional outputs.

Many adjacent TF binding sites for the same TF species form homotypic clusters, and these CRE architecture building blocks serve as a prime candidate for understanding interacting transcriptional mechanisms. Homotypic clusters are prevalent in both bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, and are present in both promoters as well as more distal enhancer/silencer elements. Here, we review previous theoretical and experimental studies that show how the complexity (number of binding sites) and spatial organization (distance between sites and overall distance from transcription start sites) of homotypic clusters influence gene expression. In particular, we describe how homotypic clusters modulate the temporal dynamics of TF binding, a mechanism that can affect gene expression, but which has not yet been sufficiently characterized. We propose further experiments on homotypic clusters that would be useful in developing mechanistic models of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Experimental investigations of eukaryotic enhancers suggest that multiple binding sites and trans-acting regulatory factors are often required for wild-type enhancer function. Genetic analysis of the stripe 2 enhancer of even-skipped (eve), an important developmental gene in Drosophila, provides support for this view. Given the importance of even-skipped expression in early Drosophila development, it might be predicted that many structural features of the stripe 2 enhancer will be evolutionarily conserved, including the DNA sequences of protein binding sites and the spacing between them. To test this hypothesis, we compared sequences of the stripe 2 enhancer between four species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. erecta and D. pseudoobscura. Our analysis revealed a large number of nucleotide substitutions in regulatory protein binding sites for bicoid, hunchback, Kruppel and giant, as well as a systematic change in the size of the enhancer. Some of the binding sites in D. melanogaster are either absent or modified in other species. One functionally important bicoid-binding site in D. melanogaster appears to be recently evolved. We, therefore, investigated possible functional consequences of sequence differences among these stripe 2 enhancers by P-element-mediated transformation. This analysis revealed that the eve stripe 2 enhancer from each of the four species drove reporter gene expression at the identical time and location in D. melanogaster embryos. Double staining of native eve protein and transgene mRNA in early embryos showed that the reporter gene mimicked native eve expression and, in every case, produced sharply defined stripes at the blastoderm stage that were coincident with eve stripe 2 protein. We argue that stripe 2 eve expression in Drosophila evolution can be viewed as being under constant stabilizing selection with respect to the location of the anterior and posterior borders of the stripe. We further hypothesize that the stripe 2 enhancer is functionally robust, so that its evolution may be governed by the fixation of both slightly deleterious and adaptive mutations in regulatory protein binding sites as well as in the spacing between binding sites. This view allows for a slow but continual turnover of functionally important changes in the stripe 2 enhancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in silico is key in understanding gene regulation. TFBS are string patterns that exhibit some variability, commonly modelled as "position weight matrices" (PWMs). Though convenient, the PWM has significant limitations, in particular the assumed independence of positions within the binding motif; and predictions based on PWMs are usually not very specific to known functional sites. Analysis here on binding sites in yeast suggests that correlation of dinucleotides is not limited to near-neighbours, but can extend over considerable gaps.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: I describe a straightforward generalization of the PWM model, that considers frequencies of dinucleotides instead of individual nucleotides. Unlike previous efforts, this method considers all dinucleotides within an extended binding region, and does not make an attempt to determine a priori the significance of particular dinucleotide correlations. I describe how to use a "dinucleotide weight matrix" (DWM) to predict binding sites, dealing in particular with the complication that its entries are not independent probabilities. Benchmarks show, for many factors, a dramatic improvement over PWMs in precision of predicting known targets. In most cases, significant further improvement arises by extending the commonly defined "core motifs" by about 10 bp on either side. Though this flanking sequence shows no strong motif at the nucleotide level, the predictive power of the dinucleotide model suggests that the "signature" in DNA sequence of protein-binding affinity extends beyond the core protein-DNA contact region.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: While computationally more demanding and slower than PWM-based approaches, this dinucleotide method is straightforward, both conceptually and in implementation, and can serve as a basis for future improvements.},

We find that the specificity of most TFs is well fit with the simple PWM model, but in some cases more complex models are required. We introduce a binding energy model (BEM) that can include energy parameters for nonindependent contributions to binding affinity. We show that in most cases where a PWM is not sufficient, a BEM that includes energy parameters for adjacent dinucleotide contributions models the specificity very well.

	abstract = {Finding where transcription factors (TFs) bind to the DNA is of key importance to decipher gene regulation at a transcriptional level. Classically, computational prediction of TF binding sites (TFBSs) is based on basic position weight matrices (PWMs) which quantitatively score binding motifs based on the observed nucleotide patterns in a set of TFBSs for the corresponding TF. Such models make the strong assumption that each nucleotide participates independently in the corresponding DNA-protein interaction and do not account for flexible length motifs. We introduce transcription factor flexible models (TFFMs) to represent TF binding properties. Based on hidden Markov models, TFFMs are flexible, and can model both position interdependence within TFBSs and variable length motifs within a single dedicated framework. The availability of thousands of experimentally validated DNA-TF interaction sequences from ChIP-seq allows for the generation of models that perform as well as PWMs for stereotypical TFs and can improve performance for TFs with flexible binding characteristics. We present a new graphical representation of the motifs that convey properties of position interdependence. TFFMs have been assessed on ChIP-seq data sets coming from the ENCODE project, revealing that they can perform better than both PWMs and the dinucleotide weight matrix extension in discriminating ChIP-seq from background sequences. Under the assumption that ChIP-seq signal values are correlated with the affinity of the TF-DNA binding, we find that TFFM scores correlate with ChIP-seq peak signals. Moreover, using available TF-DNA affinity measurements for the Max TF, we demonstrate that TFFMs constructed from ChIP-seq data correlate with published experimentally measured DNA-binding affinities. Finally, TFFMs allow for the straightforward computation of an integrated TF occupancy score across a sequence. These results demonstrate the capacity of TFFMs to accurately model DNA-protein interactions, while providing a single unified framework suitable for the next generation of TFBS prediction.},

	abstract = {A cell's ability to regulate gene transcription depends in large part on the energy with which transcription factors (TFs) bind their DNA regulatory sites. Obtaining accurate models of this binding energy is therefore an important goal for quantitative biology. In this article, we present a principled likelihood-based approach for inferring physical models of TF-DNA binding energy from the data produced by modern high-throughput binding assays. Central to our analysis is the ability to assess the relative likelihood of different model parameters given experimental observations. We take a unique approach to this problem and show how to compute likelihood without any explicit assumptions about the noise that inevitably corrupts such measurements. Sampling possible choices for model parameters according to this likelihood function, we can then make probabilistic predictions for the identities of binding sites and their physical binding energies. Applying this procedure to previously published data on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TF Abf1p, we find models of TF binding whose parameters are determined with remarkable precision. Evidence for the accuracy of these models is provided by an astonishing level of phylogenetic conservation in the predicted energies of putative binding sites. Results from in vivo and in vitro experiments also provide highly consistent characterizations of Abf1p, a result that contrasts with a previous analysis of the same data.},

	abstract = {DNA binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) are a key component of gene regulatory processes. Underlying mechanisms that explain the highly specific binding of TFs to their genomic target sites are poorly understood. A better understanding of TF-DNA binding requires the ability to quantitatively model TF binding to accessible DNA as its basic step, before additional in vivo components can be considered. Traditionally, these models were built based on nucleotide sequence. Here, we integrated 3D DNA shape information derived with a high-throughput approach into the modeling of TF binding specificities. Using support vector regression, we trained quantitative models of TF binding specificity based on protein binding microarray (PBM) data for 68 mammalian TFs. The evaluation of our models included cross-validation on specific PBM array designs, testing across different PBM array designs, and using PBM-trained models to predict relative binding affinities derived from in vitro selection combined with deep sequencing (SELEX-seq). Our results showed that shape-augmented models compared favorably to sequence-based models. Although both k-mer and DNA shape features can encode interdependencies between nucleotide positions of the binding site, using DNA shape features reduced the dimensionality of the feature space. In addition, analyzing the feature weights of DNA shape-augmented models uncovered TF family-specific structural readout mechanisms that were not revealed by the DNA sequence. As such, this work combines knowledge from structural biology and genomics, and suggests a new path toward understanding TF binding and genome function.},

When carried out in the context of a genetic selection, interacting pairs can be rapidly isolated from large combinatorial libraries. This technology has been adapted to allow the identification of DNA-binding sequences for a transcription factor (TF) from a large randomized library. This procedure uses a library of randomized binding sites upstream of a cocistronic HIS3-URA3 reporter cassette. The URA3 reporter allows self-activating sequences to be removed from the library through counter-selection. The HIS3 reporter allows sequences that are recognized by a TF to be isolated from the library, where transcriptional activation is mediated by fusion of the TF to the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase. This technology can be used to characterize monomeric, homodimeric and heterodimeric DNA-binding domains and, once a suitable library is constructed, binding sites can be identified in approximately 10 d. The bacterial one-hybrid system allows larger libraries to be searched than the corresponding yeast one-hybrid system and, unlike SELEX, it does not require purification of the TF(s). The complexity of the binding site libraries that can be searched using the bacterial system is, however, more limited than SELEX, and some eukaryotic factors may not express or fold efficiently in the bacterial system.},

We elucidate variations between different spatial cell compartments and functional modules by comparing protein-to-mRNA ratios, translational activity, and a novel descriptor for protein-specific degradation (protein half-life descriptor). This analysis helps to understand the cell's strategy to use transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms for managing protein levels. For instance, it is possible to identify modules that are subject to suppressed translation under normal conditions ("translation on demand"). In order to reduce inconsistencies between the datasets, we compiled a new reference mRNA abundance dataset and we present a novel approach to correct large microarray signals for a saturation bias. Accounting for ribosome density based on transcript length rather than ORF length improves the correlation of observed protein levels to translational activity. We discuss potential causes for the deviations of these correlations. Finally, we introduce a quantitative descriptor for protein degradation (protein half-life descriptor) and compare it to measured half-lives. The study demonstrates significant post-transcriptional control of protein levels for a number of different compartments and functional modules, which is missed when exclusively focusing on transcript levels.},

During the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and public health officials are using R$_{\textrm{t}}$ to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of R$_{\textrm{t}}$ from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make methodological recommendations. For near real-time estimation of R$_{\textrm{t}}$, we recommend the approach of Cori et al. (2013), which uses data from before time \textit{t} and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time \textit{t}, such as Wallinga and Teunis (2004), are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for some retrospective analyses. We advise against using methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), as the resulting R$_{\textrm{t}}$ estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in R$_{\textrm{t}}$ estimation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These quantities are linked by the generation interval – the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r.

	abstract = {Background Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Aim We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased. Methods We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95\% credible interval (CrI): 3.78–6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95\% CrI: 3.01–4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48\% (95\% CrI: 32–67) for Singapore and 62\% (95\% CrI: 50–76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information. Conclusion High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.},
